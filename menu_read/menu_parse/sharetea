Sharetea in Chinatown for the first time and loved it. \n\nI ordered the coffee creama. It had a delicious strong coffee flavor with a light cream. \n\nThere is a ton of seating making this an ideal meeting spot! Staff was okay. This is definitely a high volume location at. times. \n\nWill visit again!","1":"Sharetea?? Nooo thanks cuz boba is my lifeeee. Haha jk, ok maybe sometimes. Although we did splurge on bobas with the limited time we had in Houston.\n\nI heard a lot of great things about Sharetea so it was only right that we started our bubble tea binge here. The first time we went I ordered the pearl milk tea and it was amazing. They really load up on the toppings. \n\nThe second time I went, I wanted something with mini pearls. It was the first time I saw a classic black milk tea, and a fresh black milk tea. So without hesitation, we all know everything is better fresh. The catch? A couple quarters more. Honestly, it just tastes watered down and no flavor. Someone told me it's a more premium taste but for me it tasted too healthy and that's maybe because it's lactose free.\n\nA great first experience, second time iffy. So it's a 3 star for me. The third time will be my deciding factor.","2":"Update - August 1, 2019\n\nAs always, Sharetea is amazing. Today was a really busy day for a Thursday during lunch time. Literally I got there around 1:15pm, and the shop was pacccckkkeed. People were literally ordering 8+ drinks for their family and there was only 3 workers. Props to them for making over 30 drinks in like 10 minutes. \n\nToday, I ordered the Matcha Green Tea Creama. This is one of my go to savory drinks here when I'm not feeling something fruity or tea. It's so milky and creamy. The creama is kind of salty, but that's what makes it a creama. It's a good thick consistency. I would have taken a picture, but I was so thirsty I drank it right away. \n\nOne thing I would like the say though is that this shop fluctuates in temperature so much. As my go to study spot, i would want to sit in a shop at great rook temperature. However, every time I come here it's either way too hot or way too cold. The temperature has never been just right yet (It's been like this for months now).","3":"I've never been to a bubble tea place where you can adjust the sweetness of your drink- I got the Taro milk bubble tea at 80% sweetness and enjoyed it!","4":"Typically get the classic milk tea (green) with regular ice, 1\/4 sugar and 1\/4 tapioca. Actually, that's what I usually get at any tapioca joint. \n\nSharetea (like Teahouse) has endless possibilities and options. I imagine it would take a year or more to try every single kind of drink they offered. And notably they're always coming out w\/ new flavors and ideas. Like, currently they have this weird selection of Halloween drinks. (It's too early for Halloween but that's another story.) That's not something I see really too often at other tapioca locations. \n\nOnce you walk in, the whole air just smells of sugar. It's a stuffy kind of environment - although not because it's hot. The inside feels a bit sticky but is relatively clean otherwise. It's very loud as it's a popular location with many patrons. People seem to be at the tables studying although I'm not sure how with all the racket - you'd have to have some really good noise cancelling headphones in order to be able to focus. \n\nOnce you walk in directly ahead is the counter, to the right is the waiting area w\/ some benches where you pick up your order, and to the left is the line of tables that extends back into the establishment. The menu is displayed on a screen directly above the order counter. It's an open system and you can watch your drink being made to ensure cleanliness. \n\nParking is guaranteed but not guaranteed to be close - there are many, many other shops in this shopping center.","5":"Out of all the bubble tea\/smoothie places I've been to, this is by far my favorite, why? I feel like they put a lot of passion when they're making our drinks. I ordered the mango green tea; the cashier was really nice and helpful by giving me recommendations on what to get. The thing I love the most about my tea is that they added chunks of mango inside the drink and oh my God it was so refreshing. The place has a nice decor and it's really clean, overall an awesome experience and this will be my go to spot when I'm driving to Chinatown.","6":"Love this ShareTea location because the space is large and open. It's always clean. The downside is that it's not so cold inside. \nThai Tea with Tapioca is really good here. The tapioca is cooked well and has a good consistency. They use non-dairy creamer with their drinks - do what you will with that info.","7":"Walked in. They are advertising for the Chai tea with almond milk. I ordered that but they do not have it. I ordered my regular Thai tea with tapioca. I usually like the tea with out dairy, it's delicious, but they do don't that here.\n\nThey didn't put as much ice as I would have preferred. \n\nTheir Thai is really good though. I come here often for it, but it's my #3 spot for Thai tea.\n\nThey have great spots to play games with many people. I like this place. \n\nI'll be back.","8":"I love sharetea because it's one of the few places in Chinatown that doesn't have a card minimum.\n\nSharetea is my go to place for drinks. It's spacious with lots of big tables for groups. They've got ample outlets by the wall and a strong WiFi. The password when I was there was \"sharejoy\". They have no board games tho or none that I was aware of.\n\nThe drinks are completely customizable for sugar and ice levels. I usually get a wintermelon tea with aloe Vera (light and refreshing, would recommend) but I also enjoy some of their speciality drinks. I used to always get the kiwi lemon drink with aiyu jelly (it's really tasty and I love the bits of kiwi at the bottom).\n\nI came to here to do work and easy spent half the day here. Also they play great music (thanks sharetea for giving me some new edm bops to listen to)","9":"Sharetea is most likely my top teahouse in Houston as of now. That speaks volumes considering I've been to several tea cafes. My favorite tea is the Mango Green Tea Creama. Delicious. I always coach myself to try something new when I go back and I always leave with the same drink. LOL. However, I have tried the Match Green Tea Creama and it was okay.\n\nStill does not top that Mango Green Tea. \n\nNeedless to say I will be returning sooner than later. The only thing that can be slightly frustrating with when visiting Sharetea is its location. That shopping center to ALWAYS busy as ever! However, the parking garage is most likely where you'll easily find a parking spot. Keep that in mind!","10":"I finally made it to Sharetea after having it bookmarked forever! One of my fav yelp elites Chris W. Suggested it to me. Also my friend has been frequenting Sharetea and posting about it. \nIt's located in a strip on Bellaire. Parking isn't the best however I lucked up and got one close. Very spacious and clean establishment. Nice selection and reasonably priced. Since it was my first visit I went with the classic milk tea with tapioca. \nIt was very creamy, delicious, and fresh tasting! A lot sweeter than expected (next time I will adjust the sugar level). They don't skimp on the tapioca either (will ask for half tapioca next time as well). They had special St. Patrick's day cups that were really cute. Definitely will be added to my list of favorite tea establishments! Just wish there was one closer! But I love China town so no problem!","11":"My favorite boba tea place in the area! Not only are the sizes plentiful (other places usually have a medium or large option while this place has only one size that's equivalent to a large) but they have a variety of different fruit teas and milk teas. They even have a mini pearl version as well as a milk tea made with roasted brown sugar (Okinawa). Just like any other place, you can adjust the ice and sugar levels as well. The inside is also relatively spacious and clean with very quick service!","12":"They make the best strawberry green tea with boba. There are a few other drinks I like too. My favorite boba place in Houston. Just disappointed that they raised the prices and now for two boba drinks I'm paying a little over 10 dollars. This could be said for anywhere as prices have gone up, but it was nice they were under 10 for quite some time. Inflation sucks!","13":"Sorry I think this place is a taaaad too overrated. First of all, the drinks are kind of mediocre at best like I tried one of their most popular drinks and it tasted exactly like every other places that sell the same kind or similar to it except with a way higher price. Second of all--and a suggestion too-- I think it would honestly be better if y'all actually put what drink it is ON the drink like my friends ordered drinks with a similar color and they took so long figuring out which one is theirs (like of course they could have asked someone but still, putting a sign that indicates whose drink is whose would have been more efficient for both the customers and the workers).","14":"Sharetea is always busy when I go. This is my husbands favorite place for his fruit tea needs. \n\nI got the mango green milk tea today with half sugar and less ice. 5\/5. It is honestly my favorite here lately. \n\nWill most definitely be back.","15":"Came here late at night and was sad to hear that they were out of boba. :( Unfortunately this is what I was craving at this time of the night but I suppose it was reasonable given that it was pretty late into the night. The wintermelon tea was tasty, and the sizes they have here are huge.\n\nService was decent, especially given the long line that was forming this late into the night. Overall pretty good, just disappointed there was no boba at the time even though there were still tons of people waiting in line.","16":"My first ever Sharetea encounter. Honestly out of the entire Bellaire shopping center's bubble tea offerings, Sharetea has given me the best first impression. At least much better than the Kung Fu tea. That was the day I was sold on the Sharetea franchise over the Kung Fu Tea franchise. \n\nI recall that I had a 50% sweet black milk tea with boba. It was good, and actually tasted like brewed black tea. A formidable upside relative to Kung Fu Tea. \n\nAs Sharetea is in the heart of Houston's Chinatown, all the workers and customers were Asian. No surprises there. Also don't expect good customer service. If you want your wait staff giving you those false smiles and pretense that they are actually interested in your life, then stick to American places. \n\nPlus Sharetea is a Taiwanese franchise! One that actually proudly displays a relevant name in Chinese.","17":"Goodness, how do I even start with this? \n\nEver since I have first tried Sharetea (about two years now!), I have been coming here religiously, have tried almost everything on the menu, and recommended Sharetea to all my boba-loving friends (who all loves Sharetea now)!\n\nThe staff here are super friendly and will help you out if you need help picking something on the menu. The quality of the drinks are top notch; my favorites are the Strawberry Iced Blended with Lychee Jelly and the Mango Green Milk Tea with tap. \n\nThe only cons I have for the place is that if you come at rush hour (usually at night) the line to order is super long that it almost comes outside the store, but Sharetea makes it up by making the drinks fast and also, sometimes the tables aren't really clean at times. But that's really it. \n\nOverall, love it and will keep coming here continuously.","18":"Mango green tea with 80% sweetness is the way to go. Their milk tea is not my favorite but they provide tables and wifi. Great place to study or Converse with friends. Semi clean but floors look like they don't clean till the end of the day.","19":"I'm gonna get fat cuz I always go to SHARETEA\nI wanna drink 5 every day without a CARETEA\nBut I'd be 350 lbs, it isn't FAIRTEA\nStill my best feature would be my HAIRTEA\nNevertheless that's a thought I can't BEARTEA\nI'd know my legs exist but I wouldn't know WHERETEA\nI'd start to wonder if they were still THERETEA\nBarbie would dump me, she doesn't want a teddy BEARTEA\nSo I'd no longer get to photograph her mostly BARETEA\nOr posing in Sharetea with her legs crossed in the AIRTEA\nShe does Laser Removal cause it's better than NAIRTEA\nShe sometimes dates other girls but other boys RARELY\nShe thinks that the 1% treat all of us UNFAIRLY\nShe hates to cover body parts, and she does so BARELY\nShe kicks rich men in the face with her heels, quite SEVERELY\nThey pay her for the privilege and call her tooth FAIRY\nShe says it's more fun than her days at Georgetown LIBRARY\nOr her Ivy league degree she got that wasn't NECESSARY\nBut there's one place that started our Boba AFFAIRTEA\nAnd it's the Dun Huang Houston location of SHARETEA!\n\nWHAT!\n\nHappy that my review update is #499 for this amazing boba shop, where lines are often out the door and have been since they opened. Who will write #500!? Step up!\n\nSharetea, like Tea Top, Mr Wish and Boba Guys, is one of the world's best boba chains. If not the best. This is the one I first discovered - in fact this is the place that gave painful and awkward birth, with much blood loss, to my Bubble Tea obsession as it stands today. I've probably been here 230 times, and I'm not even sure I've spent 230 nights in Houston. You do the math. Actually don't. Let's move on.\n\nOwned by singer Cher (obvi), this is a Cali-centric chain that also is in DC, Atlanta, Dallas, WA state, and Toronto. You simply must try it.\n\nWhat to get: Okinawa Pearl Milk Tea (made with brown sugar)\nAnd: Classic Pearl Milk Tea - the more straightforward version, refreshing and perfect\nAnd: Whole Lemon Black Tea w\/tapioca and less ice - if you love Lemon, this may be the best Lemon Boba drink on earth.\n\nAt Sharetea the drinks are like crack\nAnd you'll keep on wanting to come back\nYou'll spend all your money\nAnd get a big tummy\nThen go round saying \"Baby Got Back\"\n\nWarning: lots of drinks are hyper sweet, you may wanna ask for less \"sucre\" (although they don't speak Spanish so you might be looked at weird and stuff)\nHow to improve: Make your hot milk teas actually piping hot!\n\nOther great places to get Bubble Tea in Houston:\n- Cha Boba (Okinawa and Hawaii Butterfly)\n- Teahouse (for fruit drinks like Strawberry Black and Lemongrass over ice)\n- Tapioca Place\/Smootea (so adorbs, great Banh Mi too)\n- Tea Top (next door or Katy)\n- Panntea (Katy)\n- Mr Wish (get Apple Black Tea and Wow Milk Tea\n\nHouston has so much great food and drinks and desserts, it seems weird that one of my fave places and most-frequented spots is actually an international chain, but in my defence, it's a rare one, and most bubble teas don't taste quite as amazing as the Okinawa Pearl from here.\n\nI'm also friends with a few of the servers. We saw each other so often while I was living in Houston that I actually miss them and wonder if they miss me. ShareTea was quite a drive from my place and there was no highway to take you directly there, but I'd still go 3-4 times a week. It was that good. I'm friends offline with Jayden and Rena now, two of the best ppl ever to work here.\n\nThey will kick you right out at closing time, and the bathrooms close up to 1 hr before the store, so bear that in mind. Come and experience the best Boba of Houston.\n\nSo if you're a rock or a flower\nOr whether you're Bradley or Gaga\nJust put your best suits on\nAnd get down to Houston\nAnd try the Sharetea Okinawa","20":"Of all the bubble tea places in Chinatown, this may be the most consistent in terms of quality while being very accommodating to personal customization.\nPositives:\n- allows sugar and ice accommodation\n- will fill drink all the way to top even if ask for less ice\n- has rewards system\n- actually decent study spot on weekdays\n- yummy tapioca\n- lots of interesting choices for drinks\n\nMy personal favorites are the fresh oolong milk tea with boba and the honey milk tea with boba. I tend to like things on the sweeter side and even I think the honey milk tea at 100% is a bit too much. The fresh oolong milk tea has a decently strong tea taste, which I appreciate. \n\nThere isn't much I have to complain about sharetea except parking, which isn't great in the entire lot.\n\nOverall, a very solid milk tea place in the area!","21":"Great selection. Long line but wait was not horrible. The place is clean and there are plenty seats inside. They've got a WiFi printer too in case anyone needs.","22":"I love Sharetea! This location is awesome. Always a short wait time. Very generous on the boba balls too. I always get a black milk tea with less ice and 50% sugar and it never disappoints. Always coming back for more!","23":"The environment was so bad as there were several guys smoking in front of the shop when I got there. Then we got in and placed the order. The server was very impatient to us. \n\nI ordered matcha milk tea and said no ice and 30% sugar but there were still a lot of ice inside and it tasted very blend on milk tea while still sweet. Even worse than Kungfu tea.","24":"My fiance loves Sharetea's Bubble Tea so we always come here.  In general, it's the boba that's good here.  Usually for me, the reg milk tea has too much dairy creamer, so don't like as much, but they do often fresh milk tea and that is good!  They are also one of the only places that have the mini bobas.  However these mini bobas are a hit of miss.  Most of the time it's great, however last Saturday night, it tasted old.  Maybe it's just an off day or maybe they didn't sell as much mini's that day so it's got left longer and was just too soft.  Their fruit teas are good.  I quite like the Kiwi Fruit Tea with Aiyu Jelly.","25":"Weekdays, this is my favorite milk tea place to come to. I love their fresh milk variety (fresh milk oohlong and fresh milk wintermelon are my favorites) and their boba balls are usually the perfect consistency too. \n\nWeekends, I'd probably go to the one in front of my place because the claustrophobia is real.\nSometimes I can barely even hear my friends because of everyone talking and I definitely was not able to get any studying done.\n\nTheir drinks are on the sweeter side so I usually get 50% sweetness and it's perfect.","26":"Come here all the time. Love this place and will continue to come here. Flavorful boba! \n\nI get either passion fruit mango green tea or the honey milk tea. I really love both and I hope you enjoy this place!","27":"Pretty comparable to any other Sharetea location that I've visited. Same menu, similar quality of drinks, pretty clean shop and decent service. \n\nMy go-to order is a hot QQ Happy Family Milk Tea with 30% sugar. The QQ Happy Family is just a regular milk tea with a hodgepodge of different toppings (e.g. boba, grass jelly, aloe, red bean, pudding, etc). My husband describes it as \"a lot going on,\" which is true, so if you're looking for something more simple, I'd recommend a drink with fewer toppings. \n\nWhat I like about Sharetea (this location, as well as the franchise in general) is that they do a good job with both their teas\/milk teas and their boba. A lot of places tend to do better in one or the other, but Sharetea hits the mark with both.","28":"This place is my new work spot. I have been coming every Saturday for the last month and really appreciate that they have a printer here in case I ever need it. The music is good. It does get noisy when the line is practically out the door but otherwise, this place is great. I don't think they serve food here but they never get mad at me for bringing outside food.\n\nI've been getting the happy family drink and am nervous to try other drinks as this one is so good! Price and portions are on point, workers are friendly and quick!","29":"The menu here is huge! So many choices, so little time. I went with the Hawaii Fruit Tea and it was amazing - felt like drinking a fruity concoction on the beach. I look forward to coming back and trying so more!","30":"My go-to boba place in Chinatown. (Sorry Gong Cha, you're just a little too pricey for me!) My favorite drinks are the mango green milk tea, the taro pearl milk tea, and the passion fruit green tea; I'll add boba to any of these, aiyu jelly to fruity drinks lacking milk, or pudding to creamy drinks (50 cents each). The Okinawa and Hokkaido pearl milk teas are good variations on the classic black milk tea, if you're looking for traditional but elevated tastes. Sometimes they'll have specials advertised on a poster, which I usually make a point to try - the toppings come included in the price for those and can be a good deal if you like \"sinkers.\"\n\nThe staff is really good about adjusting sweetness and ice levels, though there are a few drinks that come premixed and therefore can't be adjusted - just ask beforehand. Back when I was dairy-free, I was also pleased to learn that they use non-dairy creamer for the great majority of their drinks. If you want real milk, just order one of the fresh milk offerings or ask to swap out the creamer. Prices are $4-6, which is about the average for boba nowadays - it really puts things in perspective when that's more than 50% of the cost of my dinner in Chinatown...\n\n#bobaislife #bobaisking","31":"By far best tapioca milk tea in Houston. This is my gozm-to place, and there are a lot of tapioca places out there in Houston Chinatown. This place usually has a long line but totally worth it. \n\nLink your phone number to your account and get points towards free drinks! \n\nParking and traffic is annoying but the multi story parking garage behind Share tea is usually empty in the heights floors.","32":"I love all ShareTeas. This one is open late but usually busy. \nWe went on a Saturday, the place was packed. We had about 8-9 people in line ahead of us. They move the line pretty quickly though so it wasn't too bad. We got: cocoa lover, mango green tea with lychee jelly and tapioca and taro milk tea with tapioca. The drinks were good! I always get the mango green tea. It was slightly less good than other locations I think but still good.","33":"Sharetea is a great addition to the multiple of tapioca shops in Houston! Located in the bustling Dun Huang plaza in Bellaire, there are many tapioca drink competitors in walking distance, yet Sharetea is able to stand up against the crowd.\n\nMy go to order here is the Mango Green Tea Crema with tapioca pearls, less ice, and 80% sweetness. This drink has a great green tea flavor, mango for that tropical refreshing spin, tapioca for texture, and the crema on top adds this luxurious slightly salty mouth feel to balance everything out. It's the perfect drink to battle the Houston humidity. Other notable mentions for drinks include their Taro Pearl Milk Tea or their Hawaii Fruit Tea.\n\nSharetea originally came from Taiwan I believe, but dang am I happy they opened a Houston location. They accept credit card with no card minimum, which is a big deal cause I usually don't carry cash. And the packed crowds on weekends are a direct correlation of the quality drinks Sharetea has to offer.","34":"I'm giving this place 5 stars solely based on my first impression, which was the SMELL as I walked in! An intoxicating, fresh aroma of teas! But of course, I like how spacious and clean it is. And you get your drink super fast. I've had the okinawa milk tea and the mango & passion fruit green tea, both very tasty. Personally, I liked the green tea more solely based on the fact that I gravitate toward the fruity stuff as opposed to the creamy\/milky stuff. The tapioca is squishy and soft--just like it's supposed to be! I like that they have a system down for how to order, including the amount of sugar, and there are a lot of yummy sinker options!","35":"I love their bobas and personally for my first time trying the Classic Oolong Milk Tea I loved it. I am definitely comping back for seconds. I love the sweetness it's bubblicious. Also don't miss out on their pretty cool giveaways! They are sure to be epic.","36":"I really like this place!\n\nIt was a spur of the moment decision to stop by after checking out Kamalan bakery.  I knew I wanted some boba after dinner, just wasn't sure where. This place is super trendy and assumingly popular in Taiwan, like 85 bakery is. \n\nThere weren't too many people and ordering was fairly easy. The guy behind the counter was helpful and gave me his recommendations. I went with a milk tea w\/tapioca and I like that this place gives you the option of modifying the sweetness\/coldness. He asked me if I wanted to keep the sweetness\/ice and I told him I wanted it less for both! \n\nMy tea came out fast, and just the right amount of sweetness, more of a tea flavor and just the right temperature. Would definitely come back for some tea\/boba, etc!","37":"I've yet to encounter another place as consistently good as Sharetea. Maybe they don't have fancy cheese foam or funky boba flavors, but they do the original stuff right, and have original flavors that far surpass the competition in Houston. I love the original oolong milk and the Hokkaido brown sugar milk teas. The pearls here are hands down, the best  texture and flavor of all Chinatown. As someone who works in a bubble tea shop themselves, this is the quality I have in mind every time I cook boba, but never fully achieve. An easy 5 stars, every time.","38":"Sharetea is such a cute little place to get together, hangout, and drink boba. This place is also a cute little place to study as well! They have WiFi and a printer (probably have to pay for printer though). \n\nI like their drinks here as well. I'm not a big fan of there creme drinks but their other drinks are pretty good. I usually get cocoa lover with boba though because I'm a chocolate lover; however, I found a new drink that I love: winter melon with a spoon of matcha green tea powder with boba! It is so good that I think this will be my new go to drink here. Sharetea makes their boba just right; not to hard and not too chewy. The only thing that really bugged me this time and has never happened to me before is that the drinks that I got wasn't that cold. All the ice melted away or there wasn't much ice to begin with. So some parts of the drink was warm and not how I like my milk tea. \n\nOverall, I definitely like this place and would recommend it!","39":"Inside Dun Huan plaza by the entrance - easy parking - good variety and reasonable prices.\nWe liked it - highly recommend milk teas.\nTheir taro milk tea doesn't have fresh taro, so I opted for the special tea with 6 different toppings.\n\nHighly recommended.","40":"I think I had the okinawa milk tea. Wow very herbal and satisfying. Has a slight buttery taste to it from the cream, but is balance by the milky sweet tea.","41":"Idk what to say except I LOVE THIS PLACE SOO MUCH AND ITS MAH LIFE\nI love the Okinawa Pearl Milk Tea, it's delicious. I love Sharetea because they don't rip you off for extra ice or less sweet. Also, the staff is really nice. I go there so often the staff already memorized my order","42":"Great place to get some regular Black Milk Tea. Although there are other milk tea places next door and within the building complex, I always come back to Sharetea. They make their tapioca nice and chewy and oh so delicious. Their staff is nice and patient as well! They have tables on the side where people can chill or if you need to study. I like how when you walk in, there's a big area to wait for your drink to be made. I always tell myself to try new flavors but Im a scaredy cat and always go back to Black Milk tea!","43":"Hit or miss got the oolong tea taste like fish ass \n\nUsually it's good \n\nThink they were too busy\n\n\nQuality was impacted","44":"drinks are good. I tried two, hawaiian, and just regular milk tea, but i would recommend them to anyone.\nhowever, parking is one of the worst. even though they have their own parking there are just so many people at this shopping mall.","45":"Sharetea there is nothing bad to said about Sharetea. This location is located right off the Bellaire Blvd. Easy location to find and the parking can be a big hassle.  But as it is with most shops in China town. That being said expected to park far and have along walk.\n\nThis place is like crack. Always get the Classic Milk Tea Black and it's unreal how amazing it is. Strawberry  slushy with glass jelly and vanilla ice cream is out of this world.  None of the drinks I mention is too sweet. The jelly and boba was just right.  Just by talking about it make me want some more.\n\nGreat service and the employees were really nice. It's a cool idea to allow you choose how much sweetness and ice you want and their tea is amazing. Nice teahouse with good music to chill out and get some work done.","46":"It has taken me way too long to write a review this boba place. Yep, what do you know, another boba place in Chinatown. Lately, I have been coming here for boba. This place is one of the popular boba place in the plaza. It always seem to be crowded at almost every hour of the day. \n\nThe inside is a lot more spacious than other boba places. Plenty of tables, big or small for your party size. Their drinks are good sizes. I especially like their mango green tea. It has bits of dry mangoes inside. Unfortunately, I wanted to try their ombr\u00e9 drink in the bottle but they discontinued that a while ago. Overall, a nice place to grab boba. A wide selection on their menu with easy and fast services. Just beware of the long lines here and there.","47":"So many options to pick from. Ended up with the okiniwa drink bc everyone praised it so much. I just started getting into tea and this one was pretty good and unique. I've never had anything like it. It left kind of a weird aftertaste. Overall I really liked it and def would come back to try their other drinks","48":"The Okinawa pearl milk tea, kiwi fruit tea with aiyu jelly, winter melon tea, and coffee creama are my favorites! If you don't like sugar drinks then ask for 50% sugar. Service here is friendly and efficient. This is one of the larger share teas I've been too compared to LA locations. The bathrooms are also quite clean. \n\nMake sure you figure out how much sugar you want ahead of time. Sometimes the workers will give attitude about remaking the drink to fit your taste. Instead, they'll just add more ice to down the sugar flavor. It's happened to me a few times here.","49":"1 of my to go for some boba drinks every time I hang out in the china town area. Reason I didn't give 5 stars is their selection wasn't much and a bit too sweet. I always order Wintermelon tea Creama and its always so sweet even tho I order half sugar.","50":"I don't know how I haven't gone here in the past, but I'm glad I've finally given this place a try. So far, the only drink I've tried is the passion tea with orange and grapefruit, but I am obsessed; it is so good! I like that you can ask for different percentages of sugar; I get 0 zero in my drink, since the fruits are naturally sweet. This place gets really crowded, but drinks are always coming out quick. I also like that it is open til 11pm, giving me plenty time in the day to plan a visit! I will definitely be returning to try more drinks.","51":"Great quality milk tea! Super helpful staff that works through the always long lines (this place is popular!) quickly. I recommend the taro and classic oolong milk teas!","52":"mango tea is amazing! kids loved mango slush also. the sweetener doesn't have a weird after taste. highly recommend it","53":"We were in town for a family wedding and this was literally our first stop in Houston after a late-night landing at IAH!\n\nMy wife and I have mad love for Sharetea from when we lived in SoCal and we were so excited to have it again!\n\n(!) WHAT WE GOT: Oolong milk tea for me and a passion fruit tea for her--both with boba.\n\n(!) HOW IT DID: I'm not sure if it was just this one, but I wasn't as blown away with the oolong milk tea as I remember. Maybe I just hyped it up too much for myself... All in all, still a solid drink though!\n\n(!) SEATING: Lots of seating! You can definitely hang out here, and while the decor seems sparse, it's very upbeat in there.\n\n(!) PAYMENT: Yup, they take card--no minimums.\n\n(!) SERVICE & TIDBITS: There was a long line in there when we first got in, but they were pretty efficient and quick about getting to everyone and pumping those drinks out. There was even another employee with an iPad taking orders up the line. A+ for efficiency!","54":"Place is clean and comfortable to sit in. The Okinawa milk tea but it's my favorite (just wish I could tweak the sweetness level on this one) and has become my go-to boba shop. The coffee milk tea (a recommended on their menu) was eh and I wouldn't get it again. They have a rewards program where you can get a free drink after you buy like 8 or 9 drinks. All you have to do is sign up on their iPad in store and put your number in for each purchase!","55":"Very yummy drinks--my roasted brown sugar milk tea was amazing and my husband enjoyed his qq happy family tea which comes with a variety of toppings--jellies and boba galore!\n\nPlace was PACKED on a friday night and just kept getting more crowded as time went on. Lots of young teens come here to hang out it seems. I certainly wouldn't come to Sharetea to get work done or study for a test.\n\nDrinks are served quickly, employees are knowledgeable, and we left happy customers.","56":"I wanted to order a QQ HAPPY FAMILY MILK TEA and sub everything out for just PUDDING and HERB JELLY but your staff were being extremely difficult in granting my request.\n\nI have ordered from you guys before and never had a problem until her (whoever's working the morning or afternoon shift at 130pm and handled order #31)\n\nI don't know how is it any different when I'm already paying a premium of $4.50 vs a regular milk tea of $3.75 (without toppings) and I'm willing to pay more. I don't understand what's so hard in just giving me what I want.\n\nTo whoever who took my order, I've been ordering this at Sharetea since forever and never had a damn problem until you.\n\nMaybe you just had a bad day, but it's not right to treat your customers like that. This is so stupid.","57":"My favorite boba tea place is share tea. I really like their Okinawa Milk tea with roasted brown sugar the most! Their milk tea and other types aren't so bad either!\n\nTheir bathrooms are usually also pretty clean. Don't come here to study though, it can be loud. This is just a good place for group hang outs. There are plugs though!","58":"I always ordered the cold milk teas on my previous trips here, but it was really cold the other day so in lieu of the cold drink, I ordered the hot green milk tea for the first time. No regrets! This is my new go-to milk tea drink for the winter if I'm ever in Houston. I was afraid the hot drink would burn my tongue, but it was the perfect temperature! Quick service. I was in and out in what felt like 10 minutes or less.","59":"I love sharetea!  I come here often since it is near to work. The parking here is difficult since Chinatown is so busy, but I can typically get in and out fairly easily. The lines get long at times too but they are pretty fast to get everyone's order our timely. My favorite is the Mango Green Milk Tea with 0% sugar with Pearls.","60":"When in Chinatown, you may as well get some bubble tea right? Stopped by after dinner yesterday and we got the Hawaiian Fruit Tea & Caramel\/Toffee bubble tea. The fruit tea was okay for the most part. The lemon jelly like substance they put at the bottom its reminiscent of a fruit snack, but I didn't care for it and bae disliked it so much he tried to purposely avoid it while drinking the rest of the drink. My bubble tea was OK, not too sweet, but gosh they overloaded it with the bubbles. If I ever come back I'll be sure to request that they go light on those. \n\nWhile the teas were lackluster, I'll definitely say that service here is at least very fast and it needs to be considering that parking isn't the greatest. There's a larger lot off to rear side of the restaurant but space in front of it is minimal as many spaces are reserved for other establishments within the plaza or for 15 minutes only.","61":"With the five million drink shops all concentrated in one plaza, you gotta make some pretty damn good tea to stay around, and I think Sharetea does that. I've always had really good experiences at this location as they seem slightly more efficient and smooth in their operations compared to other drink shops. They also have a good variety of drinks on their menu, so everyone should be able to find something they like, regardless if you drink tea or not.\n\nOverall drink quality is solid. I like to bounce around their menu and haven't found anything that's terrible or should be avoided. I wouldn't say the quality of tea they use is the best, but it's not the cheapest kind either.","62":"Many years ago, this place was awesome.  Now, there are so many options, BETTER options nearby.   I have to say, the one thing I hate the most about this place is the cheap lady who has been working there for years.  She has refused to give me a cup holder when I ordered 3 drinks.","63":"Walked in 40 min before closing and they were out of tapioca bubbles. That's not good business when we have so many options for bubble teas these days.","64":"I have been to Sharetea three times in the past week. As a college student who is from Houston, but goes to school out of the state this is my go to spot when I come home. The boba is amazing, and my go to is a Okinawa or the Taro milk tea. The service is super speedy, and always has the drinks out and ready within a couple of minutes. In addition, Share also has good WiFi, so people can study there. There is hardly a time when I go to ShareTea and there aren't people I know there.\n\nThe drinks in the picture are Oolong tea with herb jelly, strawberry slush with lychee jelly, coffee pearl milk tea, and taro pearl milk tea.","65":"Sharetea is a chain of bubble tea places that are all over the place - I've seen them in so many different big cities.  This is the first one I've been to and I have to say the bubble tea is pretty good - they make the milk tea out of actual tea (you can choose the type) and they have a huge selection to choose from.  You can even choose the level of sweetness (I did 80% and found it still too sweet).  The 80% sweet original milk tea with boba was good - the boba was cooked perfectly and was really chewy.  I enjoyed my cup and will definitely be back.  The shop was clean and had comfortable seating and the service was fairly quick since no one was really around on a Sunday evening.  I would like to try some of the other selections as well - the passionfruit green tea drink looked fantastic and so was the selection of hokkaido milk tea! Yum yum yum if you're a boba fan!","66":"Wasn't a fan of their brown sugar milk tea (Okinawa) and the honey lemon aloe drinks. Was expecting the boba in the brown sugar one to taste like brown sugar (like Yi Fang), but it was plain and bland, not sweet at all. The milk tea itself was sweet. The honey lemon aloe drink didn't have enough honey or lemon flavor... it tasted diluted.\n\nThe drinks do come in one size, and it's pretty large for a $5 drink.","67":"Pretty good bubble tea! Bubbles are a solid, yet chewy consistency. Interesting flavors on the menu. They don't have sizes for the bubble teas though unfortunately. It's a one size fits all kind of thing. That makes the teas a little bit more expensive than your regular bubble tea place because you're basically getting a large every time, even if you wanted a small. Other than that, this is a great place to get some work done on a week day. The place is super well lit and has free WiFi. There are tables in the back where it is not as loud. Would definitely recommend this place to others.","68":"The one thing that I like about this place is that they're always changing up their menu and adding seasonal drinks or testing out new flavors. I saw a few new drinks online and wanted to give them a try.\n\nLEMON SMOOTHIE\nThis drink was their july 4th drink. The jellies were red, white, and blue stars. The concept was cute, but there was nothing special about it. All it tasted was sweet and zesty. It was like you had an overly sweet lemonade.\n\nHONEY BERRY BOBA TEA- with strawberry flavored pearl\nThis is one of those drinks that proves to you that presentation is key for business because it looked so cute and pretty on display, but in terms of flavor and how it looked in person it's lackluster. The drink was overly sweet, which I think is a standard now. I hate the fact that you have to choose your sugar level. How am I suppose to know the default is 300 scoops of sugar?! I couldn't drink it. I had to wait for the ice to water down the drink and it was so sour. I usually love sweet and sour drinks, but in this case, it was too sour and too sweet.\n\nOh sharetea~ I wanted to like you so bad. I even found excuses to come and try you out, but I can't anymore. Bye~","69":"Easily my favorite place to get bubble tea. I have tried every drink on the menu at least once and all of them are great. My favorite one is wintermelon tea and mango green milk tea. The drinks can be a bit sweet, but if you want less or no sugar in your drink they will accommodate. \n\nThey make your drinks fast and the place gets packed on the weekends. Workers are friendly and the bathroom is fairly clean given the area. \n\nHighly recommend this place to anyone wanting bubble tea.","70":"Although it can get crowded, it is a nice place to hang out with friends and study. Drinks are delicious and the service is not bad, they make the drinks pretty fast.","71":"I came here when they were having a 1.00 sale on drinks, so it was fairly crowded. Some sort of anniversary sale or something like that... a certain milestone of stores open. Decent regular price and service.","72":"This is a nice little place in a good area close to restaurants, bakeries, freeway; here you can slow down and sip a variety of teas, visit with friends, and\/or laptop.  Service seems to be pretty efficient. prices reasonable. Parking good, and for looking out onto a parking lot, still light\/bright and not unpleasant surroundings.","73":"I love milk tea so I had to check this place out after a friend recommended it to me! \n\nTheir menu is fairly simple and categorized based on types of teas: fruit teas, milk teas, etc. What I like is that they have measurable sweetness levels from full regular sweet to 50% to unsweetened. \n\nI had the oolong milk tea with pearls (80% sweet) and my bf had the handmade taro with fresh milk and mini pearls. My oolong was amazing. It had that nutty, roasted taste and the boba was chewy, perfectly balanced in sweetness. Would definitely get again. The handmade taro was different from what we expected. First, we thought it was legit taro (the purple potato kind of like Ube) but it wasn't. It had the consistency of someone just having roughly blended the cooked root quickly as it was still chunky. The biggest mistake was adding the mini pearls in it, ruined the texture. It was almost too sweet. Definitely interesting but wouldn't recommend or get again. \n\nThe size of the drinks plus the prices are what makes me wanna come back. I'm dying to try their roasted brown sugar next! Highly recommend their milk teas :)","74":"Spot of tea? I saw this place on a trip with my family to the markets and decided to give it a try. Oh so good. I remember the thing that stood out is that their tapioca balls are sweet and also freshly boiled with each cup. Staff is very nice and there are plenty of flavors to choose from. \n\nI'll be returning here whenever I'm in town.","75":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! My go-to drink is the mango green tea with egg pudding. I must warn you. If you don't like super sweet drinks, ask for 30% sugar. I love that the mango green tea includes mango pur\u00e9e which makes the drink absolutely yummy. My other drink fav is wintermelon tea creama. The creama is like a salted sea foam.","76":"Hands down my favorite place to come and get boba. My go to drinks are the Hawaii Fruit Tea, Okinawa Pearl Milk Tea, Coffee Milk Tea, and Mango Passion Fruit Green Tea. Their drinks are on the sweeter side so I usually ask for less sugar, but other than that I have no complaints. They have a good variety of drinks to choose from and they'll fill up 1\/4 to 1\/3 of your cup with whichever topping you ask for. That's a lot of boba!!","77":"This is one of the best bubble store in H-town. I have seen this boba tea for a while but they seem to get popularly crowded lately. I am curious, so I give it a try. \n\nThe store offers many unique options of drinks compared to other stores. The sweetness level is also less than other stores too. I ordered matcha green tea blended with boba. I love that they add the vanilla ice cream into it. However, my friends ordered Milk tea with boba and his boba is still very hot and he got too much boba like almost half the cup. So, he was disappointed about it (and I am too).\n\nThe taste of boba: It's good but it's still not the best ( I still prefer Kungfu tea boba). Also, if you switch the option like boba or red bean to something else, they don't charge you extra which is a plus for me.\n\nOverall, I give this store a 4 star. It's good even though it's not the best of the best yet. I will try this store some more times to see if my opinion still stays the same.","78":"Sharetea is definitely one of my favorite bubble tea spots. I think their teas are smoother and creamier than the other bubble tea spots. I love the many options of teas that they have on their menu. You can also customize your drink by selecting the sweetness level percentage and ice level preferences. You can also add toppings such a mini boba. My usual go-to order is OOLONG MILK TEA with MINI BOBA PEARLS and 50% SUGAR. Just keep in mind that they only have one size drinks -- a large size. Parking can be a pain as it's usually full in front of the joint. Try parking on the side of the shopping center. Lines for ordering can go out the door on weekends when it's busy. \n\nOverall, will continue to support Sharetea with my business. They've opened a new location in GA (closer to me), but I think Houston's Sharetea is better!","79":"I'm pretty particular with milk teas: it can't be too powdery or too sweet and the boba has to be cooked just right (not too hard, not too mushy). I got the original milk tea with boba and herbal jelly. This place fulfilled all of my requirements and an added bonus- the herbal jelly isn't rubbery like the place we shall not name- KFT.","80":"Came here around 3p and it wasn't busy so the drinks came out really fast! \nI got the QQ Happy Family Milk Tea and it was so good that I almost came back for another one later in the day! The milk tea isn't too sweet at all, even at regular sweetness. Definitely love Milk Tea if you're looking for that nostalgic Taiwanese taste because of the toppings -- red bean, tapioca, jelly and others as well! It was definitely the perfect bit of everything. \nMy boyfriend got the Mango Ice Blend and as an avid mango lover he definitely says that Sharetea has one of the best mango slushes! Creamy with a scoop of ice cream, he says that the proportions are perfect. \nDefinitely recommend stopping by here if you haven't yet!","81":"My standard bubble tea shop in Chinatown! Disclaimer: Sharetea is one of my favorite chains and bubble tea places in general, and this location doesn't disprove that. \n\nLines can be a bit long on weekends but they churn out the drinks pretty quickly. There's a lot of seating and I've seen people studying here on multiple occasions, although it may be a bit loud for that on weekends. One of the best things is that this location doesn't have a card minimum! \n\nOverall, my go-to place for bubble tea that has yet to go wrong.","82":"Bad service. Wait 15 min to get boba. The drink was not as expected and the fruit was not fresh","83":"I got the wintermelon mild tea with creama and pudding. Quick. Good service. Drink was yummy. I got 50% less sugar which was just right for me. I can't imagine how sweet 100% would be . Anyways, it was good but not mind blowing\/best I had or anything like that. Then again, I am from NYC so my standards are quite high. \n\nIt looks like they have wifi and good studying space here too. So I guess if you're a student, this can be a place to study in (headphones would definitely be needed). ***CREDIT ACCEPTED.","84":"Finallllyy found a milk tea spot that is consistent and I'm ok with trying something new here without finding it disgusting. \n\nFav to least fav drinks:\nWintermelon with fresh milk - top of my list! It's light and refreshing.\nWintermelon with creama \nMango green tea - another one I'd order again. I like the mango bits at the bottom! \nMango green tea creama \nMango ice blend with ice cream - so good & not artificial tasting. Sugar level cannot be adjusted so it can be too sweet for some. \nOkinawa milk tea - sweetened with brown sugar & tastes like Sweet\/Tout Suite milk tea. \nStrawberry ice blend with lychee jelly and ice cream - sugar overload but good for a hot summer day. Cannot adjust sugar level. \nTaro milk tea - on the heavy side & could use a little more taro flavor. \nMatcha ice blend with red bean and ice cream - so hard to suck. lol omg. It's not terrible but I wouldn't recommend for a first timer. \nHandmade taro with fresh milk - not very sweet and ice is not blended all the way. Cannot adjust sugar level. Pass! \n\nI always get 30-50% sugar cause I don't want diabetus unless it's an ice blended drink then I'll just have to live with it. Service could share a little gratitude and emotion. Parking always sucks.","85":"I actually like the Sugar Land location better however this place is good too do not get me wrong! The drinks are still very good and the service is nice but it has a different feel to it. The place is too spacious in my opinion with not many tables for that amount of space but it has a modern look to it which I do like :)","86":"The worst location...well I mean there's only 2 that I know of but that's beside the point, its bad ok.  So this place is extremely crowded and extremely loud.  A very young crowd likes to frequent here to gather with friends but I can assure you the quality of the drinks don't justify the crowd.  To begin with, the drinks are not cold enough and they do have a menu way above that illustrates what percentage of ice you want. Uhmmm how about you just give me a cold drrink like any other normal place.  Based on how warm my drink was, I just couldnt really enjoy it and everything went downhill from there.  I was really unimpressed and just really felt like I wasted my time and money coming here.  There are plenty of options in the area so they really need to improve on the flavoring!","87":"I always get the Hawaii tea. It has pineapple in it and it so fruity and tropical. Great when you just need a sweet break!\n\nThey have a point system that accumulates each visit and every 10 points gets you a free drink! Not a bad deal, huh?","88":"I have been here twice - first time I got the matcha green tea with red bean and the next time I got the Mango green tea with boba. Both really good. \n\nThey are able to customize your drink: the amount of ice and the amount of sugars. Also you can add extra toppings too.\n\nThe service is very quick and speedy. Overall it was a great experience and service.","89":"Lol I always get the same drink (ice cream green tea) SUPER GOOD. Even though this place is alwayyyssss packed, they serve drinks fast. I've never had any problems I love this place","90":"This is probably one of my go to places for a place to grab some quick tap, hang out with friends, or just to do some homework. Employees are always there to greet you with a smile and there to give you any recommendations. Their service here is always superb and it never takes more than 2 minutes to get your drink, even on a busy hours! They have a great variety of drinks and countless customizations to add. If you want a quiet place to do some homework or just hangout with friends after eating this is the place to go to! :)","91":"Saw a few of these guys in Bellaire and other areas of Houston, I was curious so I tried! Cleanliness wasn't cutting it, there was trash in the floor and don't even mention the sticky floors! The customer service wasn't too welcoming, I was trying to navigate the menu being my first time to Sharetea, but the cashier was just rushing me. I even said give me a sec...it's my first time! The pressure was real. My milk tea wasn't memorable in any way, so I don't think I would return! Too much competition in china town to settle!","92":"I come here often, and their drinks are good every time I go. Pearls are good consistency, and it's a good size. Pretty busy- depends on when you go, but I've never had a hard time finding somewhere to sit.","93":"That Okinawa pearl milk tea with roasted brown sugar. Wowza. \n\nThat's enough of a review in my opinion, but ... Sharetea is great! \n\nThe venue is spacious, well lit, and easy to find. Parking is parking in Chinatown lol. I love the variability of the menu; pretty sure I could make endless combinations with bases, toppings, sugar contents, etc. For the amount of tea you get (bigger than the large at most tea shops), the price is a steal. \n\nThe Okinawa roasted brown sugar is the most delicious tea flavor I have tried in my modest 7 year boba career. If you enjoy anything that tastes like toasted heaven, you've found your treat. I didn't finish my whole drink, and was pleasantly surprised that the tapioca pearls were still the same solid, chewy consistency the next day (other places return a slime ball syndrome after sitting in the fridge overnight). \n\nGlad to know I don't have to think twice about where to go for my boba fix the next time I'm in Chinatown. Love love love!","94":"I thought Sharetea was alright, but I probably won't be hurrying back here to get my boba fix in.\n\nThis place must be super popular, because the line was out the door!  Unfortunately, they didn't appear to have the right amount of staff to handle the demand... after placing our orders, it took them about ten minutes to make our drinks.\n\nI ordered the matcha red bean bubble tea.  I really enjoyed the strong matcha flavor, and the chunks of red bean added both some nice texture and sweetness to my drink.  But... they didn't take my order correctly.  I wanted 50% sweet, no ice.  Well, they loaded my drink up with ice blocks and my milk tea was so sugary sweet that I highly doubt it was actually 50% (or if it was, then their \"regular\" sweetness levels must have an insanely high amount of sugar).\n\nOVERALL: 3\/5.  Ok, I probably come off as a little bit grumpy in this review.  I do like the fact that Sharetea has a lot more flavors and varieties than most other boba shops I've been to in Houston.  But, I would rather go to some other bubble tea shops in Houston that are faster and cheaper than Sharetea to get my boba!","95":"This is an awesome teahouse for refreshing flavors and a variety of cool toppings. I came into my visit with very high expectations after receiving some glowing endorsements and I must admit that I was impressed at not being disappointed at all. I ordered the Ginger Milk Tea with real aloe Vera mix in (not the gel version) and the drink had an amazingly authentic flavor to it. I felt like sipping tea brewed with real ginger in every sip and the refreshment factor was legit to counter this heat wave in Houston. Additionally, the aloe Vera was very crunchy and combined great with the ginger flavoring. Overall, it was a really solid beverage that my wife and I could both savor thanks to the large default size. Prices are reasonable too and ambience is nice but the only caveat is the large crowds that can pile up at a moment's notice. But that last downside is a worthy trade off for being at such a happening teahouse after all. Four thumbs way up!","96":"I got the Okinawa pearl milk tea and it is surprisingly unique. It is a little sweet but not overwhelmingly so. The brown sugar makes the drink rich and creamy but it is not sickening and it is, in fact, quite addicting. I'm disappointed I could not have it less sweet than what they recommend but I can see myself getting this drink again in the future. The taste oddly somewhat reminds me of 85\u00b0's taro latte if it was sweetened with bamboo sugar, if that makes sense. It's different and I like it.","97":"the milk tea here is very good! i'm kind of a boba fanatic so i'm always looking for new places. this place has great teas, is pretty good, has great service, and the best thing is that they are almost always open late.","98":"First time here.. The drinks were good like others, but the tapioca\/bubba were too chewy and tough..","99":"With so many boba options in China town, it gets overwhelming when you have to choose where to go. I've been to a number of boba places in Chinatown, but I like share tea because of their ice cream topping options. Yes, boba with ice cream sounds super Americanized, but it's not. Black tea + boba + ice cream is the way to go. I ask for the tea to be less sweet since the ice cream is already sugar loaded. The drink is creamy and delicious, and their boba is soft all the way through (which is a deal breaker for me if it's not). \n\nTips: ask for no ice so you get more tea (the ice cream is already cold enough) and wait a little bit before drinking so that the icecream can melt a bit!","100":"--- NK Score = 8.2\/10 ---\n\n8\/10 = Furniture\/Ambience\n8\/10 = Drink Quality\n9\/10 = Service\n7\/10 = Prices\n(Other Ratings Hidden)\n_____________________________________________\n\n=( BASIC INFO )=\n\n- Medium Sized Store\n- Usually Busy (Post-Lunch\/Dinner)\n- Good Drinks ( $4.00 - $5.50 )\n- Tasty Citrus, Tea, Combinations\n- Somewhat Pricy, Depends\n- Further Parking, During Rush\n_____________________________________________\n\n= Atmosphere =\n\nCasual ambience, nicely lit interior with a good range of available seating as well as space to move around.

The taro pearl tea here is also hands down the best in town. Highly recommended","102":"My fav tea place for years. Andrew and Adam are the best workers there they are so hard working and so nice to their customers. My fav drink is that kiwi drink I forgot the name but I love it","103":"Lovely place with a long line! It's worth coming once and a while!\n(Decoration) \nIt's really good to just sit down and relax after a long day. This tea place is decorated with pictures of some of their drinks and may explain what's in it. It's a simple store with many colors! Even if there is a long line!\n(Drinks)\nThis place drinks are good quality, but with average price tag. You have many choices and you can make your own. They have this  sweetness level to change how sweet your drink is. For right now, you can only make it less sweeter.\n   I ordered a mixed berry (strawberry) with lychee jelly and ice cream. Its very good and has an interesting taste! The cocoa lover is great for those who love chocolate milk. Don't have it if you do not like or drink milk. (Sweetness depends on what you choose) The Hawaiian Fruit Tea is great also! \n(Overall)\nIt's a small colorful store that may have a line. With delicious and wonderful drinks. Its worth coming once and a while!","104":"One of my favorite bubble tea spots in Chinatown. Great place for milk tea and fruit tea. The seasonal drinks are also very good. The tea is super authentic and consistent. Of all the time I've been here, they've never messed-up my drink. \n\nMy favorite time to visit are weekday afternoons. It's not busy and quiet enough to get some work done. Unfortunately, on weekend night, expect to wait up to 15-20 minutes to order and get your drink. \n\nComparing Sharetea to Gong Cha, the milk tea at ShareTea is heavier on the tea taste and the tapioca is less sweet, which I prefer. However, Gong Cha has more variety in toppings, size, and drink options. \n\nShareTea still remains my number one choice for bubble tea because I know exactly what to expect every single time (and the loyalty program).","105":"Go get the fresh milk with real tea! It's real tea you can taste! If you don't want it too sweet just cut if half and there you go. so far another awesome oolong tea milk tea in my list.","106":"Pretty good. My friend got it for me and I loved it. One of the best milk tea I've ever tried. Added to my fav milk tea list.","107":"Sharetea has some of the most authentic-tasting milk tea I've had in Houston. I came on a Sunday afternoon and didn't have to wait very long for my drinks.I tried their original milk tea and the Hokkaido milk tea. According to the owner the Hokkaido milk tea has caramel and toffee in it, which gives it a different taste than normal milk teas (which I thought was pretty unique). I could definitely taste a difference. I enjoyed both of the drinks I tried, and especially liked how they're really generous with their boba. The interior is very clean and minimalistic, and their restrooms are surprisingly clean as well.","108":"I'm not sure if I'm going to continue coming here , at the Chinatown location it's really bad , first of all quality control secondly inventory then finally the same female staff was so rude with her oops I'm sorry attitude.","109":"Honestly not one of my favorite boba places in Houston. NOt sure if it's b\/c Gong cha has finally graced Houston with its presence, but I can't get behind the hype of ShareTea.\n\nI've gotten a few of their flavors, like the classic pearl milk tea. Their boba is solid, don't get me wrong. It's got the great texture that I expect of boba places in Houston now that there are many other competing boba stores. HOwever, this store is just WAY too much sugar for me personally. I can handle sugar levels, but at ShareTea, I usually have to ask for 25-50% sugar to get it to a tolerable level. \n\nThey're located in the front part of Don Huang plaza, where parking is a little tight if you wanted to get parking right next to ShareTea, but the CHinatown plaza has lots of places to park. It just gets kinda hectic on weekend nights. \n\nTL;DR - not one of my favorite boba places. If you like sugar, maybe, but I recommend KFT or Gong Cha.","110":"This is the place to go if you're wanting milk tea. I've tried most of their teas and they all tasted awesome. My two favorites are the mango crema and the matcha crema. During peak hours like F\/S\/Ss the lines are long but they move fast. Never have to wait for then 5-8 mins. Sometimes people don't know what they want when the get to the front of the line and that is what takes long so I suggest looking online or at the back of the line and figure what you want before getting there. Everything is good. There are plenty of sitting area inside and out. Parking sucks but it's bellaire.","111":"My friend told me about this place and today is my first try. Fresh milk black tea with boba tastes great. You can see real milk and it tastes very milky. I will try the \"Creama\"s next time. I used to love Gong Cha but this first try of Sharetea is definitely not worse than Gong Cha at all.","112":"One of the best boba places I've been to! I tried the winter melon milk tea at 1\/2 sweetness with boba and it was amazing (it still was a little too sweet after like half the drink so I would do 30% next time). The boba was the perfect amount of soft and chewy and sweet but not too syrupy. I love that you can customize the sweetness level and the ice level!\n\nDefinitely would recommend and I want to come back and try more flavors!","113":"One of my top favorite places for milk tea\/ boba. I usually get oolong milk tea - my fav. The regular sugar level is perfect amount of sweetness for me. The drinks are consistent every time. The atmosphere and interior of the place is super chill and nice. Great place for boba!","114":"First time coming here, and I have to admit, this is probably one of the best milk teas I've ever had! I listened to the tips about lowering the sugar intake on my Taro Pearl Milk Tea and made it 80%, which was the perfect amount of sweetness for me. They also aren't cheap with the boba pearls at all and the price is great for the size! Will definitely be coming back!","115":"West coast bubble tea does not disappoint. There was no \"fake\" aftertaste, and with the adjustment of sugar level, it wasn't overbearingly sweet either. Service was great, and the menu diversity was pretty extensive.","116":"I just recently ordered a Taro Ice Blended with Fresh Milk, one of my favorite, but this time was different, there a lot of ice pieces not being blended well, also it was watery. It supposed to have a smoothie texture, it notice this because i myself work at ShareTea location in Austin. I hope the employees of this ShareTea location take note and improve the quality of the drinks. Thank you","117":"Out of the million milk tea options out there, Sharetea is my favorite so far. This place has the best Taiwanese style milk tea and you can customize your order to fit your taste.\n\nI'm a traditionalist so I always order the classic black milk tea (you can either pick black tea, green tea or oolong tea). This place is also great for anyone lactose intolerant or vegan as they offer non-dairy options as well as fresh milk.\n\nThis place is usually always packed on the weekend but seems to be a good spot for anyone in need of wifi during the week or in the daytime.","118":"This is by far the BEST tapioca place in bellaire! They have so many options too choose from. Favorite part of this place is how they taste so good and natural. Tried other places where they just use to much powder.  The tapioca here is so good and it you can actually taste a hint of honey making it so much better. This place can get busy of the weekends but it is totally worth it. Also they have a star system where you can get a free smoothie after 10 drinks which can add up since their smoothies are so addicting:)","119":"i think this place is just average.\ni got the whole lemon black tea , which was literally what it was and had an entire lemon in there. \nit was refreshing and tart (from the lemon of course) but it wasn't very practical to put a whole lemon in there because my straw couldn't reach the bottom of the cup so i couldn't suck up any tapioca balls until i took the lemon out. \nmy bf that for some reason finds enjoyment in drinking dairy (ew) , got the coffee creama and said he enjoyed it so i decided to take a tiny sip and almost threw up because it literally just tasted like sweet extra extra heavy cream, literally felt nauseous and thought 8 pimples were about to pop out my face, but then again this is coming from someone that hates dairy drinks. \n \ni would probably come back another time to try something else out, \ni do appreciate the bright and roomy atmosphere.","120":"This is one of my favorite boba spot, really like the friendly and fast service. One time, they finished making my drink before I was finished paying. Overall, I really the boba texture is nice, soft, not too chewy and jelly is enough crunchy. Definitely one of my regular boba spot to come back.","121":"Pretty solid 10\/10! I had the honey milk tea tapioca and it was delightful! This place is always jumping and crowded and now I can see why! The cashier was very helpful and informative while servicing my pal and I. After downing this peace of Heaven, it has definitely given me a reason to make a pit stop in the midst of chaos of the incompetent drivers of good ol Bellaire blvd.","122":"Although I'm not a bubble tea fan. Wallet is the only thing I watch out for. Yes, I also watch my figure. I'm done searching for a better place for Bubble Tea - Milk Tea - Cold Drink in Chinatown, after I have many wonderful experiences at Sharetea.\n\nI have been looking at this location from its infancy: the moment they took over this space from eCosway. I remember the day the contractors asked me to move my car while I was shopping at L P Trading next door, so they could hang the sign. I tilt my head to read the sign while leaning on its side. It didn't make sense.\n\nThen, Sharetea started to follow me on Instagram. That's how I learned about this wonderful business from Taiwan called \u6b47\u8173\u4ead. It literally means \"to unwind at a pavilion\" in Chinese. Yes, I cherish every moment that I am at Sharetea sipping my Tea - Creama - Hot Tea - Cold Drink. \n\nI have tried each category. My favorites are Mango Creama, Winter Melon Iced Tea and High Mountain Hot Tea. My tummy didn't like \"milk\" with iced tea. I wish I could try everything on the menu. But for now, I'll stick with what I know.","123":"Came here after eating dinner around 9pm. There wasn't a crowd when we got there so we took our time reading the menu. I got the coffee creama with pearls and it was delicious. My boyfriend got the Hawaiian?  I forgot what it was called. We were both not a fan of that LOL he got back in line and got the green tea creama and it was a lot better. By the time he got back I line though, the line was almost out the door and almost took 20 minutes to get to the front. \n\nWe'll come back maybe if the line isn't too crazy.","124":"Delicious and high quality. I grew up in Chinatown I know my drinks. They are also open late which is great. Their coffee creama and their taro are great Pierre the coffee crema is extremely unique and stands way above the other places. Another way they stand out is that they let you choose your sweetness level and milk and they use roasted brown sugar which makes things very personalized and flavorful\n\n Friendly staff. Nice boba.","125":"GO ON A DAY WHEN IT'S NOT LIKELY TO BE CROWDED.\n\nWeekdays, mid-day are when the drinks are the best. When if gets crowded the drinks get rushed more and sometimes you might get an off-drink a little too sweet or too much flavoring.\n\nBesides that I enjoy the place a good amount. Honey milk tea is really good here. Other places I've tried honey milk tea it's always been too sweet.\n\nDon't expect amazing customer service. They're just low wage workers trying to get through the day.","126":"Tea is alright not too many options. Servers are almost always rude! My advice go to Nu teahouse next door it's way better.","127":"Sharetea is my new favorite drink house in Chinatown! The line is always crazy long, so try to get there as close to when they open if you can (11 am) to avoid the crowd. \n\nI've had 3 drinks here so far:\n1. Okinawa pearl milk tea (made with roasted brown sugar, less ice)\n2. Taro pearl milk tea (80% sugar, less ice)\n3. Honey boba (regular)\n\nOut of these three drinks, the Okinawa pearl was my favorite. It has a... well, roasted\/nutty aroma that is absolutely delicious. I didn't think it was too sweet, either. Perfect for me! \n\nI must say that I am obsessed with the boba pearls here. Perfectly \"QQ\" and SO yummy! Can't wait to go back and try the Happy Family drink and Classic Milk Tea!\n\nPS Also had a great experience with service- another plus for this place in my book!","128":"My son likes this place!  Busy, spacious...popular with the younger set this place has wifi, nice tables and plenty of milk tea and coffee for those long tete a tetes!  Hopping as I'm checking it out, I can see where this would be a great place to hang out with your friends!  Chinatown has really blossomed in that sense!  The only complaint I have is they don't really have smoothies which is my drink of choice!  Star, Snow, Ice still makes my favorite Strawberry Banana smoothie!  \n\nI like this place for the ambience and my kids really seem to like it!  I like the fact that the music is not blasting like some places and the space is nice, airy and colorful!  Service is nice and they even have a rewards program.  You'll find out how it works if you're a regular. \n\nI'd have to say this would be a place I would feel comfortable crashing at if I had my laptop and a stack of good reading and friends. \n\nCheck it out!","129":"Ever since living in HTX, I have made weekly trips to get boba here. It is located in Chinatown in the popular shopping strip where there are plenty of boba shops and dessert stores next door. Depending on the time you come, there can be no line or a very long line (mostly at night). They have a variety of drinks to choose from including milk tea to slushes.\n\nThe milk tea is great with the right amount of sweetness. You can make it less sweet or more sweet based on your preference. The QQ milk tea (one of the more popular items) have different pudding and jelly at the bottom making it a fun drink. I also like the taro milk tea and the taro slush with pudding at the bottom. If you really want the taro to be fresh, you can try the handmade taro drink. The handmade taro drink is more starchy and does taste like an actual taro. \n\nThey also have drinks where there is a foamy top layer. I am not a fan of this (not because of Sharetea) but my boyfriend really likes the foam. If you want some boba, definitely come check this place out!","130":"I love coming to this bubble tea place when I'm in town. The service is good and the atmosphere has good vibes.","131":"Literally my favorite place for boba in Houston. \n\nWhen Sharetea first opened up in Houston, I did not get the hype. The lines were way to long and parking was extremely limited. Finally, I gave this place a try about a year later.\n\nThe lines aren't as long as they used to be, but the place is still quite busy. My friend ordered the coffee milk tea with no ice and half the sugar, and I ordered the classic milk tea with no ice and regular sugar. The drinks came out really quickly and nothing was wrong with the orders.\n\nThe teas were strong, super creamy, and slightly sweet, just how I like it. The boba was at a great consistency and slightly sweet. The ratio between the tea and boba was just right. \n\nOverall, this place was actually worth the hype. I'd definitely come back.","132":"This was the first Sharetea location I've been to and I actually ended up not liking Sharetea for awhile because of them! I got the creama tea the first time and it was way way way too sweet. Admittedly, I didn't get less sugar like I do at most places, but this was a lot sweeter than most places' drinks' at the regular sweetness level. \n\nI tried Sharetea again at the Sugar Land location and I actually enjoyed it a lot more. I actually like Sharetea a lot now. I don't think the drinks are made as well here though. It's always busy as well which could be why the drinks don't have consistency in regards to sweetness. If I was getting boba in Chinatown, this one probably wouldn't be in my top go to list. But overall, I still like Sharetea as a whole!","133":"This place is overhyped. That about sums it up... \n\nI will say, their standard milk tea is pretty good, very creamy and smooth, and their boba is cooked well and has a good amount of sweetness to it, but I tried their crema drinks, and did not like it at all... \n\nI like the balance of sweet and salty, and I think it's an innovative idea to have a frothy salted topping, but I didn't really like the flavor so much. I couldn't even finish the drink. I guess it just wasn't what I expected. I actually tried 2 different crema drinks thinking maybe I just didn't pick the right flavors. I got a fruity one (which wasn't very good because it was like salty peaches...) and then an chocolate one (which wasn't as bad, sort of reminded me of a Starbucks frappacino but more salty like the beach rather than sweet). They do give this cute little knife thing to cut and sip the drink. \n\nI also was a bit disappointed because I asked for boba in my drink, and they messed it up, and all I got was a \"I'm sorry\". -.- \n\nI will say the atmosphere is more hipster and there are more people at this place, and the pricing is a bit pricey... But normal depending on the drinks. \n\nIf I go again, I'm sticking to just the milk tea.","134":"I love love love their mango green milk tea! It is really good! I mean it is really good and fresh. I have been here several times already and never tried anything else, but only mango green milk tea. Maybe I should try something else next time. By the way, their price is good too especially for people like me. I don't like boba or anything else. I just want mango and green mink tea.","135":"Sharetea's been a favorite of a lot of my friends over the past year but honestly.... I haven't been impressed yet. I've tried several of their drinks and they're mostly too sweet for my liking. The boba is done well - there's a nice bite to them with a good amount of sugar but again, their standard drink without any alterations in sugar was basically liquid diabetes. It's usually packed on weekends and drinks are typically slow to come out. One thing I definitely liked about Sharetea is their cleanliness. Their restroom (on the day that I visited) was immaculate and blindingly white.","136":"The most tea flavor I have tasted out of all the tea bars around! At first I asked for the high mountain creama and I was told it would have been a 15 minute wait since they were still brewing the high mountain tea in the back.\n\nThey freshly brew all their teas and add real milk to make it nice and fresh and real. This is a tea bar originally from Taiwan, popular in Cali for a long time and finally arrived in Houston.\n\nThe creamas are interesting. They put a layer of \"homemade\" cream that is sweet and salty at the same time, on top of the tea you choose.\n\nPersonally I think their teas are a bit bitter for me. But it's one of the most REAL milkteas I have had in Houston.","137":"Contrary to what my girlfriend thinks, I like Sharetea. The place is very bright and the decor is nice.\n\nThe coffee creama that I got was very good in my opinion, and better than most coffee drinks at other boba places.\n\nMy girlfriend, on the other hand, ordered the whole lemon black tea. I can see why she was upset. It was actually a whole lemon in the drink. I had to help her take out the lemon so minus one star for a poor concept.\n\nSharetea is a boba spot I'd come back and try again. Oh, I saw Kev Jumba there too!","138":"Amazing staff members who are friendly, patient, and willing to help. This is also a very nice environment to hang out and catch up with friends - very spacious shop with a lot of table settings. \n\nSince sharetea is a chain, there's not much I can comment on because so long as they deliver drinks consistently, it's good enough. However I can recommend to try the wintermelon crema!","139":"I wanted to check this place out since my friends\/family loved it in Dallas.  Got the winter melon creama.  Let's just say it tasted like sugared milk.  I couldn't finish it.  Decided to go to Tea Bar the next day and noticed that Sharetea was super-packed! Not sure why. Maybe I ordered the wrong drink..........maybe I'll give it another try. For now, I prefer Phi's or Kung Fu Tea for my winter melon milk tea.","140":"I love Sharetea  \n\nThis is one of my favorite milk tea places in town. \n\nFriendly location where you can study or hang out with friends in the weekend. \n\nStaffs are friendly and the milk teas definitely delicious  \n\nI love their QQ milk tea and black milk tea.\n\nHighly recommended","141":"I only ever get either one of two drinks from here. It's like most other good boba places. But the two drinks that I tend to revisit each and every time are the taro cereal slushy or the mango green tea crema with egg pudding. Every other drink, I feel you can get at other tea places. Not saying they're not good or not to get them, but the two drinks are something you can not get anywhere else.\n\nThe fruity pebbles bits and pieces flirt with the taro slushy and leave a charming burst of flavor in your mouth.\nThe mango crema with pudding is my usual. I drink it 2 ways depending on how I feel. They suggest you make 2 holes. One to sip with a straw and one to get the creme flavor. Sometimes I turn the cup upside down and watch the creme mix in like a lava lamp. No need for 2 holes and makes your green tea crema experience much more convenient. The egg pudding adds a more neutralizing effect to the sweetness of the mango green tea and creme.\n\nThis place is also a good hangout spot after you eat, or if you need to do some homework.","142":"Awesome tea. I think what makes this place standout is the atmosphere. They have a wde variety of teas and drinks for you to pick from.","143":"Easily my favorite bubble tea (or Boba, as people like to call it here) spot in Houston, Sharetea serves great drinks of all sorts. While it claims to be the number one spot for tea in Taipei, I don't recall ever trying this chain out in Taiwan, but I was pleasantly surprised when I tried their bubble tea at this Houston location.\n\nI judge the quality of a bubble tea place by its original milk tea with tapioca, and Sharetea's rendition tops its nearby competition handily. The tea itself tastes good with a nice amount of creaminess, but more importantly, the Boba itself is consistently cooked perfectly with the right amount of chew. Honeybee just across the street is consistently overcooked, while other places like Teahouse and Nu Ice love to serve undercooked Boba. Sharetea's consistency is one of the biggest reasons they deserve five stars.\n\nThe other big reason this store is like no other in Houston is because they follow the typical Taiwanese format of serving bubble tea by asking the amount of ice and sugar you want in 30\/50\/70\/100 fractions. Many other places serve tea that is way too sweet for my liking, making sugar the only discernable flavor. At Sharetea, I typically go for the 50 or 70 sugar, with less ice. \n\nOverall, Sharetea is my go to spot for Boba in Houston, and is superior to its competitors in taste and quality.","144":"Try the passionfruit yogurt slushee with lychee jelly. It's a bit pricey at almost $6, but it's cool and refreshing on a hot day--more so than my beloved milk tea with boba. Space is ample and bright, with lots of seating. \n\nMy only gripe was they didn't call out numbers so our drinks were sitting on the counter for probably 25 minutes before we realized they were ours.","145":"Sharetea is always poppin! Out of all the boba places in Bellaire, Sharetea is probably the one I frequent the most. My usual order is the Taro Ice Blended with ice cream and tapioca. Ice cream is a game changer! If I'm not feeling that, I'll usually order the Okinawa. Yum! Even though Sharetea stays busy, they run through the orders pretty quickly!","146":"Boy this line was out the door when we arrived on Sunday late afternoon, so make sure you have some time to spend waiting around a bit for your drink. The line moved quite slow since there was only one person at the register, and maybe four or more making the drinks behind her?\n\nAnyways, I got the black iced milk tea with boba, 30% sweetened and this was gooood. Very refreshing, big size and the boba was perfectly fresh and chewy. While the milk tea may be simple but it's hard to find a place that can make it just right, and i think Sharetea did it! Tried the iced cocoa lover and that was good as well. \n\nWorth the long line for me, will definitely be back. This location is in the Dun Huang plaza towards the front.","147":"Matcha green tea creama 5\/5!\n\nGot it with:\n-balls (superb). Chewy-fresh and warm.\n-30% sugar- I like how you can customize on the touch screen.\n\nReally delicious. Was light, but you could still distinctly taste the Matcha (which is an already light flavor in my opinion). The creama (cream foam) at the top is great. Its like the add it a little more salt within the cream so you'll be surprised with that contrast. I shake it at the end so I can get the experience of the main flavor.\n\nI'm starting to be impressed with most of the selections. I wish they can present some samples like they do in other boba places, but its fine.\n\n\nTo Do:\n-Wintermelon drink\n-Matcha red bean for next time.","148":"Sugar water.\n\nI thought I would give this \"Fresh Milk\" a shot, since most tapioca joints use milk powder in their milk teas. Not only was it way too sweet, but it lacked any taste of tea. The tea was probably so watered down that my drink became just sugar water...\n\nThe service was not any better at all. Orders took way too long to be placed, and drinks took at least 30 minutes to be made. There were only a decent amount of people, not even close to a full house. The 3 workers they had in the tight space behind the counter making drinks looked as if they were lost and confused half the time, the other half they were completely relaxed as if there was no rush to fulfill the insane number of orders they had. I stood there for a while watching them take their sweet time, not a hint of worry for the customers who were slowly growing more and more impatient. \n\nLastly, while the colors and decorations of the place makes it seem bright and lively, the white floors were a huge mistake. Dark, black smudges and shoeprints could be seen all over the floor, creating an unorganized and dirty type of atmosphere. Trash was also overflowing out of the bins. Not somewhere I would sit down comfortably and enjoy a drink with friends. \n\nWith the opening of Sharetea at the same time as Class 502 (next to Kung Fu), I count a total of TEN tapioca shops in this plaza ALONE. Sharetea will have to step up their game immensely if it wants to survive the crazy competition.","149":"Excited this authentic Taiwanese milk tea chain opened here as they are popular in many parts of Asia. We went after lunch and there was a constant long line to the door. They have a lot of options to choose from, even some unique ones I haven't seen in other stores like the Okinawa or Hokkaido milk teas. You can also choose your sugar and ice level. Unfortunately, they ran out of the regular tapioca balls and I didn't want to wait another 30 mins for it so I settled for the mini tapioca. I got the classic black milk tea with mini tapioca and pudding. Tea was good and had a distinct milk tea taste. Pudding was surprisingly good, it was actually thick and had flavor, which I like. \n\nAs we were sitting there, we saw the frustration of customers who had to wait more than 30 mins for their drinks. I think right now, their still training the trainees and don't have enough staff to produce out drinks fast enough. I hope in time, this problem will be fixed, but I'll be returning to try their creama and different varieties of drinks!","150":"Im a fan for sure, but waiting 45 mins for a drink...I dont know what I was thinking about.\n\nI was in line waiting saying to myself, nah this ill clear up in 15 mins.....well I said the same thing 15 mins later....next thing you know I was in too deep and said Fudge it.\n\nWhen I got the the counter the employees had this, \"end my misery look\" or \"dont **** with me today\" maybe all of the above.","151":"I actually really like Sharetea. But I've only tried one drink from here, which is the Creama green tea. I loveeee this drink. So creamy and refreshing. Prices for tapioca drinks are a little high here compared to other tea places. I'll be back to try the other drinks. Oh and the reason I took a star out, is because they don't let you order to go over the phone. Sucks, cause this place does get busy.","152":"A lot of yelp reviews have been complaining about slow service but I actually got my drink really fast!\n\nFirst time here and the cashier was really patient and helpful in recommending what to order. I ended up getting the Okinawa pearl milk tea ($4) which has a light roasted brown sugar taste. I asked if I could customize the sweetness level, and the cashier told me that there's no sugar added in this drink. Woah nice! I could, however, customize the ice level so i asked for less ice.\n\nIt tasted more \"naturally sweetened\" than the heavily sweet milk teas of other places. Pleasant for me but for people who like their drinks really sweet, I probably wouldn't recommend this one. \n\nThey have a lot of interesting drinks on the menu that I definitely want to come back to try, including the Hokkaido milk tea which I hear is another customer favorite, and a sizable selection of creama teas. Yum!\n\nthe place is well lit and spacious. Relatively quiet when I came on a Tuesday afternoon\/evening to get some studying\/work done. I will be back!","153":"I was there late night when they first opened and didn't want anything caffeinated, so I went with the Wintermelon Brewed Tea w\/ no sugar as this was \"highly recommended\" on their menu and had no caffeine.  This tasted good initially, but it started tasting bizarre to the point I couldn't finish it.\n\nI did come back one more time and ordered a kiwi tea drink with some weird jelly.  Although I ordered half-sweet, it was still much too sweet for me.  I should I mention they were also out of tapioca, so I couldn't experience that either.  I haven't found a good drink here yet...  What should I order?!  Help me.","154":"Great place to grab a quick drink alone or with some friends. Fast service and the workers are always friendly and willing to help if you have any trouble picking from their wide variety of drinks. \n\nThey also have plenty of tables for large groups and small groups to sit around and chat or play some board games, which I've seen as a trend here. \n\nMany people also come alone or with a someone to have a quick study session while having a drink. (They have a wifi) \n\nI usually go here when I'm in that part of town!","155":"Year after year, the milk tea industry grows more competitive.  Sharetea is arguably near the top of the rankings and after a heavy salty lunch, that extra stomach exclusively for milk tea starts nudging and winking.  Residing in Austin, I haven't explored the milk tea in Houston much, but I figured Sharetea would be a fair baseline.\n\nSharetea definitely gives off the new hip vibe.  The colors and the space is inviting and the staff definitely makes sure you have all the time and knowledge you need to make the right decisions, especially when you get your pick of sweetness and ice.  My order was in the midst of seven drinks, and they came out after 5 minutes; pretty darn fast!\n\nNow, I'm not one to be found relaxing at a tea place for very long, so I'll be more critical of the actual tea rather than the wifi or the opportunities for studying.  I ordered the Milk Black Tea with half sugar and less ice.  The drinks are a lot creamier than the other places I've been to, which is definitely new for me.  This is certainly a big factor on whether you prefer a thicker milk or a thinner tea texture.  Their boba is fairly bland, and I wish they marinaded them in honey like some other places do.  They also aren't very soft.\n\nOverall, the drinks are nice, but if I'm choosing a milk tea place based solely on taste, I'll probably try somewhere else.","156":"Sharetea always gets my order perfectly and their boba is always on point. I also like how their drinks are just the right amount of sweetness. My favorites are the oolong milk tea and the matcha milk tea. The only thing is I wish they had more flavors. I know they have seasonal promotional flavors, but they should keep the ones that are really popular like Thai tea.","157":"I ordered the coffee milk tea and it was good. Taste like roasted coffee with he richness of milk black tea. Didn't think  coffee would go well with milk tea but it did. My fiance order the Mango juice bulb thing. She didn't like it much cause the Mango waa very overpowering. Nice facility especially for youngsters.","158":"Probably one of the best tea spots in the city.  Loved the variety and freshness of the drinks.   I tried a crema beverage - matcha green tea crema - it was delicious and I highly recommend.  The top foam\/cream is slightly salty, the tea was fresh and the tapioca was the perfect consistency.","159":"Do you like Taro smoothies? Do you like Fruity Pebbles cereal? Well, guess what?!?! Taro Cereal Smoothie is the best drink that I personally enjoy!!! I'm totally biased because I don't know any other place with this drink. The combination of the love of Taro with the sweet grit of the Fruity Pebble-like mixture, comes this heavenly refreshing concoction of bliss! \n\nRegular with tapioca is a guaranteed perfection, imo. But also if you swap the tapioca with ice cream, it'll give it a creamier taste. \n\nTRY IT BEFORE IT DISAPPEARS AGAIN!!!","160":"Been to plenty of shareteas. Great boba joint. This particular one was absolutely terrible. The young girl in the front was so rude. I asked a question only to get snapped back at. Not that a boba cafe entails much service. But it certainly shouldn't leave your day ruined. Not only did the girls attitude leave a bad taste in my mouth, the drinks we orders came out terrible. My boyfriend ordered a simple taro with boba. It was warm... LUKE WARM. I understand how the drink is made. So I understand it starts warm and chilled with ice. But not enough ice was put into it, that all the ice melted and my bf drink was warm as soon as we got it... It was rather disgusting. Now, I ordered a happy family qq. My drink wasn't warm but it was completely watered down. The milk tea had no flavor, and they were so stingy with the toppings. I don't say this not knowing how much they usually put. I'm comparing from other shareteas that are more than fair with their toppings. I will never be coming back to this place. You guys should also save your money and a ruined day. Go to a different one. If the other one is too far, there's three other bubble tea cafes in this plaza. Your welcome.","161":"Same as everyone. It takes too dang long. There were 2 customers before us. It took them 12 minutes to produce 4 drinks. 5 people are behind the counter. I don't know what's happening. \n\nUpdate:  tried the qq happy family today (1\/15\/17). Asked to sub herb jelly for extra tapioca. But since I ordered 2 other drinks with it and was in a hurry, I didn't think to check the drink when I grabbed the bag. Got home and it's only herb jelly, egg pudding, red bean and lychee. No boba at all!!! Large or small! Lesson learned...must check!","162":"Service is on the slower end but nonetheless drink order correct. Was recommended the Okinawa Pearl Milk Tea, but sweetness cannot be adjusted with that drink...and it ended up too sweet for my taste unfortunately. Also tried the Hokkaido...which was more preferable. No light bulb or stardust drinks at this location. Hoping to use the same rewards system as the one located in Sugar Land!","163":"My second favorite boba shop in Houston. Very good and not expensive. Definitely worth another visit. I believe after every 10 drinks bought you get the next one for free.","164":"service is fast; i was probably in there for less than five minutes to order two drinks. the (baby) boba was cooked perfectly. the only thing i didn't find right was the fact that when they make your drink, they would use a long spoon that's been sitting in some cloudy water in some cup. idk if it's cloudy because there's some special solution to keep it \"clean\" or if it's just plain dirty, but i get a little iffy when it comes to reusing materials for different types of drinks, especially if they aren't mine. overall the flavor was very good, though (i got the iced hokkaido milk tea). my only problem was the sharing of the tools they used.","165":"The softest balls I've ever put in my mouth!  Really delicious tea and great environment in  of Chinatown.","166":"Probably my second favorite place to get boba in Houston. \n\nShare tea is getting really hyped up in Dallas so I thought I give it a try in Houston. My first time was really great. The cashier girl was really informative with the drinks. I told her I didn't like really sweet teas and she let me know before hand that their regular level of sweetness would be too sweet for me. She suggested going down to 25% sugar or no sugar. I tried the Hawaiian tea with 25% sugar and though it was good still too sweet for me. When I came back the second time I ordered a pineapple green tea with no sugar and it was PERFECT. They're also one of the few places that offer ai-yu jelly and mini boba. \n\nI can see myself being a regular when the Dallas locations open up.","167":"Our family really like the milk tea here. It is so fresh. We normally get the oolong milk tea.","168":"I came to this place because I tried the  wintermelon milk tea from sharetea located in Sugar Land and I loved it! But since this place located on Bellaire had the same name and is closer to my house I decided to try it but it's not the same.. they're wintermelon milk tea taste like milk with sugar.","169":"The best milk tea in Houston, in my opinion. \n\nThe milk tea is sweet, so I usually like to get one of the less-sugar options just so I don't feel like I'm drinking straight up sugar. \n\nThe classic milk tea with boba is my favorite. The wife always gets egg pudding in hers. \n\nThe Cocoa Lover is apparently one of their top 10 most popular drinks, but we thought it tasted like chocolate milk. Probably wouldn't get it again, not special enough. \n\nLines can be long here, but the employees crank the drinks out at a pretty decent clip, so that at least helps a bit with the wait time. \n\nThere's also a rewards program where you can earn a free drink after so many drinks purchased.","170":"On my second visit to Houston, I gave this place another try, and this time it was up to standards with the ones in Bay Area.\n\nThe review on my first visit was probably due to a bartender's bad day. My friend noticed that he hasn't seen that bartender since our first visit.","171":"The first place in Houston I could find my favorite Fresh Milk with Oolong Tea. They also have Coffee Milk tea and Hawaii Fruit Tea. These drinks are delicious.","172":"Tried the wintermelon creama tea and asked for 30% sugar, but it was still super sweet. Not sure if they forgot or that's their 30%.. Because of this, I'm glad that I got the creama tea with a thick layer of what tasted like salted...cream? The combination reduced the sweetness of just the wintermelon tea. The boba was pretty solid. \n\nThe interior is pretty spacious with a lot of natural light in the front and are good for studying or catching up with a friend!\n\nI may make my way around to ShareTea to try their other menu items after trying all the boba shops in the area :3","173":"I love the options they give you here. \nSuch a wide variety of boba\/bubble tea with all sorts of customizations.\nA go to place for boba for sure.","174":"Yummy and friendly service! Great location easy to find and the jelly has a hint of coffee - mmmm!","175":"Yeeesss Sharetea! I'm a bigger fan of Sharetea than KFT. The classic boba milk tea is made with a creamer, which tastes super creamy obviously. The fresh boba milk tea is made with whole milk instead. The smoothies and slushes are all pretty great as well. They only sell them in one size, and you can customize your ice and sweetness levels. My regular order is the oolong milk tea with no ice (it's still coldish) and half sweetness.\n\nI think this sharetea does a rewards system based off of your phone number that they get from your credit card, and it's a free drink every 10 purchases. There's also people who study here sometimes because there's free wifi. However, this location is popular with the local high school\/college aged kids, so expect the occasional rush of them and it being loud.","176":"Yay! Another favorite boba shop in Houston. I actually came when it first opened and was sorely disappointed and avoided this place like the plaquge, but every time I passed by I always saw a huge line, so finally caved and gave it another try. So glad I did!\n\nOriginally I was super indecisive as the bad experience from their opening was still stuck in my head, but the nice worker offered me a sample of the creama when I asked what it was, and that was the end of the story. The creama is basically a heavy cream mixed with sea salt that goes on top of your drink. I like the richness of the heavy cream and the sea salt adds a nice touch, especially to balance out the sweetness of the drink. I got the earl grey tea with creama and my husband got the QQ drink, both delicious. In my mind the QQ drink is like an  \"include every topping please\" milk tea since it comes with so many things: large and small boba, pudding, lychee jelly, red bean, and grass jelly. I would never have thought that all those different toppings work so well together, but they really do. When you're drinking\/eating it, you are literally chewing pudding one second and then boba the next, and then your right side is chewing red bean while the left side is enjoying lychee jelly as you swallow milk tea all in the span of 5 seconds. Definitely a new experience, but delicious nonetheless. \n\nThe quality of the tea has definitely improved since opening, although I probably still favor the tea from Kung Fu Tea. However, I would definitely come back for the creama and especially when I just don't want to deal with attitude at Kung Fu tea.","177":"The last time I was here was a year ago, and they've updated their loyalty program since then. They've updated to a phone number points system vs their old stamp cards. The hype about it has died down a bit since it first opened, but business seems steady and crowd in here can fluctuate. (Been sitting here for 3 hours lol.)\n\nI got the Okinawa pearl milk tea this time, and you cannot adjust the sweetness on this one. Possibly bc of the roasted brown sugar factor and how it's made, but totally fine. I like sweet drinks, but not sickeningly sweet, and this drink has the perfect amount of sweetness. You can definitely taste the earthiness or I guess, warmth, of the flavor of the drink.\n\nI usually get no toppings and no pearls. (Leaves more room for drink.) Wi-Fi goes in and out at times, and there's ample table space if you need to do any sort of work on a laptop or journaling. Great for groups and you're bound to run into someone you know here. (Esp if you're a college student or recently was one.)\n\nAdding a star from my previous review bc I liked my visit more this time around. Didn't have to wait in as long a line as last time and it's less busy overall. And I got a better drink this time lol.","178":"Wow, this is seriously long overdue.  I absolutely love coming here; I am totally addicted to the Okinawa Milk tea that is brewed with roasted brown sugar.  The first time I came I was greeted by an extremely sweet young girl named Alice who always had a huge smile and quickly knew my order, but she has since moved away to Seattle.  Every single one of the gals and guys is super sweet; I have dealt with Aaron and Darryl A LOT!  They are so cool and sweet and always eager to talk.  They already know I am the Okinawa girl lol.\n\nI have tried Hokkaido Milk tea and have to admit I was reluctant because I had this at another place and it tasted so artificial.  Imagine my surprise when I took my first sip and found nothing artificial tasting about it.  It was sweet without being \"diabeetus\" sweet lol.  It was smooth and rich; it definitely changed my thoughts on the Hokkaido.\n\nI have found that when I ordered the Hawaii Fruit Tea, Mango & Passion Fruit Green Tea and Mango Green Tea that they are super sweet and always mean to ask to adjust the sugar 50%; this is another plus about them - you can adjust the sugar and\/or ice levels to suit your tastes.  Each green tea flavor is super refreshing and flavorful - you can really taste the fruit in the teas.  I recently had the Aiyu jelly which I was pleasantly thrilled about; I really like the unique citrus flavor profile.  The baby tapioca is my favorite and is always perfect when I opt for some.  Aaron and Darryl are really good about going easy on the boba when I ask for it.  Recently I tried the Oreo Ice Blend which was equivalent to an Oreo shake and more of a real desert.  I have also had the fresh milk black tea which was interesting, but seriously nothing can take me away from my Okinawa tea!\n\nThere can be a line, but I find they staff are really good about getting drinks moving and can't complain about any long waits.","179":"This place has a fairly average tea selection. While their tapioca has remained consistently chewy and not overcooked, i think their recent price hike on drinks has just left a slight negative impression to me. Service is good. But other than that, I don't find this place unique or special that sets itself apart from other boba places","180":"I heard about this place from my cousin while in Houston. Originally, I was inclined in going to visit Honey Bee Teahouse and am glad I came here instead. Apparently, Sharetea started in Taiwan so you know this place is legit. There are plenty of flavors (e.g. coffee, taro, traditional milk tea, etc.) to choose from as well as tapioca replacements (e.g. pudding, aloe vera, various jellies, etc.). \n\nSharetea is spacious with plenty of tables to enjoy your drink and also a potential spot to get some studying\/work done. I'll definitely be returning when I'm in Houston again.","181":"This is my favorite place for milk tea or tapioca in Chinatown. Reason being is because of the creama tea options. Cream is this salted heavy cream foam thing that pairs perfectly with your drink. I always get my drink with 30% sweetness, which is perfect for me. \n\nDon't be deterred by the long lines; they go fast. They also have a rewards system.","182":"Sharetea was so good, I'm glad we were able to stop by here to grab a drink while in Houston. It was busy, but drinks were made quick. We will be coming back for sure.","183":"I came around 1:30pm and it was a FULL house. I stood in line for probably 10 minutes. The milk tea is very refreshing for this hot Houston weather. Pearls are soft and sweet, not really that chewy. Great drinks though!","184":"This place has so much hype and I don't really understand it. Been there 3 times and every time there has been some sort of issue with the drink. \n\nFirst time I went I ordered the taro milk tea. The flavor was gunky and strange but I thought to my self, maybe it's just the taro and tea (most places don't do taro and tea)\n\nSecond time I ordered strawberry black tea and oh my god it was so sweet. It was like drinking sugar. \n\nThird time I ordered the mango passionfruit green tea and I asked for less sugar, and that time it was fine, but there were little passion fruit seeds in the drink that totally freaked me out. Like, finding something crunchy in your tapioca drink is absolutely horrifying! \n\nOnly saving grace for this place is that their boba is cooked right and the Aloe Vera as a sinker.","185":"I am writing this as I wait for my tea. it has been 20 min since I ordered. and that was after I waited in line 30 min. \nall of this time wasted for just one cup of mango green tea with aloe Vera. if this is not dedication then I don't know what is. \n\nsuper popular new hang out place. and super crowded. not a lot of chairs and tables inside but if I am just grabbing it and go it doesn't matter much. \n\noverall I love their tea so much. much better than Kungfu and other places in Chinatown! keep up the good work","186":"The QQ happy family milk tea has beans, lychee jelly, grass jelly and egg pudding in milk tea. It came to a surprise to me as I don't usually like fruit flavors in my milk tea and sadly the menu wasn't descriptive. I wouldn't order this again, it was a weird mixture.\n\nThe oolong milk tea is ver refreshing. Perfectly light and simple with a nice herb taste. Simple! \n\nThe earl gray taro milk tea is also refreshing. It wasn't too sweet but had an earthy, milk taste which wasn't over powering to the taste buds.","187":"This place is a joke or what. Congratulations on your advertisements worked so well that fooled everyone!  And there people line up for this crap I can't believe it Your mango green tea taste like pure syrup with water I don't taste tea at all. And how much powder and concentrate sugar did u put in my friends milk tea. Holy cow u really wanna give your customers some serious diabetes. Let's forget about the drinks for second. I walked in I felt like the employees are working in some kinda factory  assembly-line. The looks on their face for us is like the hell u looking at. I am having a bad day don't piss me off.   The attitude make me feel like they don't need my money they got enough fuck u and get out of here.  I know I ain't coming here no more. For those of you who wanna continue drinking this crap and pay 5 dollar for some unhealthy crap like this keep it up!!","188":"Ahhh I was so excited to get the bottle with my boba! But it was only limited edition  I got the happy family milk tea boba and it was like a party in my mouth with everything mixed in like boba, lychee jelly and Mango pudding!  Yummm I got regular sweetness and light ice \n\nNext time I'll try mango green tea\n\nYay for getting points towards a free drink and taking Amex with no minimum!","189":"Sharetea has never really wowed me. The milk teas and cremas are usually too artificially sweet flavored for my liking. However service is usually quick and friendly.","190":"Although the line can be ridiculously long at times, this is one of my favorite tapioca spots! They have gotten better at servicing their customers and shortening the wait time for their drinks but it may still take a while if there are a lot of customers ordering drinks. \nI love creamy drinks so the creme added in gives it a perfect touch! Every time I visit, my drinks are always on point and because of that, I love the consistency that ShareTea has. I honestly think the drinks are worth the wait. \nPS Get the wintermelon tea with creme!! It's the bomb dot com!!","191":"You can't get any more authentic than this! I mean where else can you get an more authentic boba tea from Taiwan if not from a Taiwanese boba tea chain? That's why I was super ecstatic when I found out that Sharetea - a fast-growing boba tea chain hailing from Taiwan - has opened a branch in Houston!\n\nHurray!\n\nNo really, if you want to get real boba tea, look no further than Sharetea (although Tap House is still equally my favorite too) because it truly delivers the taste that I remembered when I was in Taiwan. In other words, this is the real deal! Expect good quality tea with the right amount of milk plus tapioca at the perfect texture, and plus, you can even adjust the sweetness to your preference. Price is the average $4 and credit card is accepted, so there's no reason to choose anything over this place unless it's a matter of location!\n\nDon't be sad that you can't taste real boba tea because you can't go to Taiwan, because Sharetea has brought it across the ocean to you!","192":"It saddens me to write this about my go-to Milk Tea spot, but what I witnessed today is not acceptable or excusable.\n\nMy friends and I were waiting for our drinks, and we saw an employee walk to the back area to blow his nose a couple times then walk right back up to start making drinks without washing his hands. Thankfully it wasn't any of our drinks, but I do feel bad for whosever drinks those were.\n\nHopefully this is a one time occurrence, and they immediately nip this in the butt because I do really like this establishment. I'll keep coming, but Sharetea, you've gotta ensure the quality of not just your products, but of the people behind the counter also.\n\nStill love your drinks, but this is a wake up call.","193":"Good experience here! Finding parking is an absolute nightmare though so beware of that. I got the taro pearl milk tea with mini tapioca pearls and bf got the honey milk tea. My taro milk tea was very sweet and tasted almost like a chocolate or cookies n cream shake which was kinda weird! It was also pretty heavy, so I was full after drinking 3\/4 of it and nearly skipped dinner. Maybe I'll opt for a lighter fruit tea next time! Bf liked his honey milk tea, but wished he got normal milk tea as the honey taste was a bit overpowering, but still good nonetheless. Clean interior with plenty of seating. We'll be back on a less busy day of the week for Chinatown.","194":"Very cute wall decor. If I lived in Houston I would definitely come here to hang out with my friends. It just give off that cool and hip spot. The employees were nice too. I got the Oolong Milk Tea with bubbles. It wasn't as sweet as I expected it to be. I prefer my milk tea sweet, but I still enjoyed it. I will probably be back!","195":"The store wars rage on with shots fired by Sharetea setting up shop right next to Tea Bar. For the past year, Kung Fu Tea had a vise grip on the top position in my heart and on my tongue for tea spots (sneaky pun intended: tea spots for a spot of tea? nailed it). Sharetea's offerings are of a comparatively high quality with fresh ingredients at a competitive price point.\n\nLike some other shops, Sharetea gives you the option to adjust the sweetness of your drink. I don't prefer my milk tea to be too decadent, so I almost always ask for \"half sweet.\" I tried the mango green milk tea and, while not cloyingly saccharine, it was reminiscent of a creamsicle. Still a solid product if that's your cup of tea (pun most definitely intended).\n\nIf you have mild OCD like myself, you might cringe when you see that their preset sweetness levels are 100%, 80%(!), 50%, 30%(?!?!) and 0%. Why would you do this to us?! Have you TRIED ordering something \"three-tenth's sweet\"? I doubt your measurements are so precise that you couldn't just say 75% and 25% anyway.\n\nIt should be noted that they take plastic with no minimum purchase. In Chinatown. #savage This is a make-or-break factor if I'm not carrying cash. Or when I don't have friends to hang out with...which is why I'm sitting at home alone in my underwear writing a Yelp review.\n\nFYI: Despite the Sharetea moniker, every attempt I've made to have strangers share their teas with me have been met with confused stares. C'mon y'all, don't be greed-tea! *badum tsss*","196":"This is my favorite tapioca spot in Houston to date. I was skeptical at first seeing as there are about a million tapioca joints scattered around Chinatown, but curiosity got the best of me and I've never looked back.\n\nMy favorite drink there is their Matcha Green Tea Creama (half sugar, less ice). I love anything green tea\/matcha so when I discovered this drink, it's like I died and gone to heaven. Yes, there is a distinct earthiness from the matcha, but the sweet and sour layer of cream at the top gives it a nice balance between all the different flavors and it's uniqueness separates them from the other shops.\n\nThe staff is also very friendly and knowledgeable, which helped me immensely during my first visit here!","197":"Sharetea is the best tea shop in town, period. Unless you want to see me rage, don't mention that other tapioca spot in my presence- its name rhymes with Dung Poo- which is suggestive of what I think of that place  (hint: shit). \n\nThis chain originated from Taiwan, and I got hooked when I tried their teas in the Bay area. Now that they've arrived in Houston, I don't see any reason to go anywhere else for my boba fix. \n\nThe drinks are excellent, and you can customize your sugar and ice intake. The taro slush with egg pudding is my current favorite. Not as impressed with the taro fresh milk- it's mostly whole milk with bits of taro. I feel weird drinking this much whole milk as an adult. \n\nTheir teas seem strong (or maybe I'm just weak), because I once drank the Hokkaido milk tea at 9 PM and couldn't fall asleep for the following 12 hours. I figure this is something that excites you caffeine addicts.\n\nIf you love having a lot of QQ (chew) in your drink, get the QQ Happy Family. Tapioca, jelly, pudding are all included, or you can specify the ingredients you prefer. My friend orders this drink every time because it offers the \"best value.\" \n\nThere is no credit card minimum, and they have a frequent buyer program to reward your loyalty. The employees are all exceedingly nice, even when I'm asking a ton of questions and holding up the line (sorry). They actually VALUE your business and treat you like a person, which is more than I can say for Dung Poo. \n\nDuring peak hours, the line can look pretty frightening, but good things come to those who wait.","198":"Today was our first time trying Sharetea located in Bellaire and we ordered a few drinks:\n\nReview:\nWait time: 10 minutes which is a little disappointing compared to other teahouse we get our order in less than 2 or 3 min. Maybe because it's a new business and still working on getting a faster flow to completing orders in a faster pace. \n\nOrder placed:\nMango passion fruit- very sweet, tasty, with a tarty taste. Overall, a very good drink that we would recommend for tea lovers.\n\nStrawberry black tea- the strawberry black tea had both blended flavors of strawberry and traditional black tea but the strawberry tasted very artificial. The taste of the drinks is somewhat of a bitter sweet taste.\n\nOkinawa pearl- the drink has a unique flavor compared to other milk teas with a less sweet taste than normal milk tea. If you are used to the typical milk tea do not expect the same flavor with the Okinawa pearl tea. \n\nEnvironment: the environment caters to the young crowd with large tables, spacious area, and big crowds that limits seating.\n\n-A.L.B.A","199":"Sharetea is growing on me! I tend to stick to my favorite at another boba place in the plaza, but I'm glad I gave Sharetea a chance. I'm excited to come back and try their other flavors.\n\nOverall - 4\/5 stars:\nSharetea has a large selection of drinks, including non-caffeinated options and new drinks for special occasions\/seasons. You can also adjust the amount of ice and sugar in your drink. Their serving size is generous and for every 10th drink you buy, you get one free if you check out with your phone number\/card. The ambience is bright, lively, and usually bustling with customers. On weekends, don't be surprised if you see the line going out the door. As for the service, the workers are friendly and make sure to get your order exactly the way you want it. The reason I gave 4 stars over 5 is that the floor was quite dirty and trash was left on tables when I visited.\n\nMy order - 3.5\/5 stars:\nDuring my visit, I got the matcha green tea creama. I enjoyed it at first, but as the name suggests, the drink was pretty thick. It was a bit too heavy for me to finish since it was also still quite sweet, even with 50% sugar. I may try it again in the future, but with 30% sugar. From trying friends' drinks, Sharetea's drinks seem pretty sweet overall. I would opt for 50% or less sugar unless you're really craving that extra sweetness.","200":"This place is always busy which confirms they are good. The menu isn't to extensive so it helps in making a decision. I ordered the strawberry iced blend with lychee and ice cream. Epically sweet! Pics attached.\n\nPS: don't forget the punch card","201":"This is one of my to go place to drink some fresh ice tea at these Chinese places. I don't know but those people can make some food tea.","202":"I thoroughly enjoy coming to Sharetea. The service is always fast, even when there's a line out the door! I haven't had a bad drink flavor yet. I suggest the 'Happy Family' or the \"Okinawa\". Both are great in flavor and I've never had to change the ice or sugar level. My only complaint is parking, which you can't blame them for. The shopping center that Sharetea is in is always so busy! So, be prepared to fight for parking! Luckily, they DO NOT have a card limit, so enjoy that! Because if you go next door or elsewhere in Chinatown, there will be atleast a $10 limit.","203":"The first time I was there, their AC was broken or something and I waited like 20 minutes in 90 degree heat for my drink. Their coffee milk tea is good and honey green tea was refreshing! So that's why I gave them another chance and came back again this weekend. This time we asked them what was good and they recommended the Okinawa milk tea and honey lemon green tea with aloe Vera. Both were great! We'll be back if we're in the area, but if you're down Chinatown then there are better places","204":"The Okinawa milk tea is really good. I get mine quarter sweet with light ice and it hits the spot ever time. \n\nThe only downside is that this bubble tea joint is a little on the pricey side.","205":"I'm really upset that I waited 4 numbers past mine to get my drinks. I ordered a handmade taro and asked for an extra scoop. They made my drink, but it didn't fill up to the top. He just added more milk. My drink just tastes like milk.\n\nI have had the handmade taro before, and it was better. And to the response that I got saying the milk is added last, I watched him pour milk FIRST AND LAST.\n\nLast time I had a matcha red bean, which was good. I've also tried the different style milk teas, which are good. This time, I was very disappointed. I'll be back to try other things and update my review.","206":"Can I tell you, omgoodness their drinks are so good. I love my drinks with egg pudding. Also Okinawa drink with brown sugar is the bomb. Must get it!!!!","207":"We love that there is normally no crazy long line here and that there's a printer so students can print things and hang out and do hw. My husband got the QQ drink which had boba, jellies, and other goodies. He did 50% sweetness and it was delicious! I got the okinawa milk tea which is roasted with brown sugar and I didn't adjust the sweetness and it was way too sweet for my taste. They don't tell you that you're able to adjust the sweetness when you're ordering and I wish that that's something ppl would tell their customers since ppl who aren't locals who don't frequent these places wouldn't know that... We went back the next day and got some kind of matcha red bean ice cream drink, yo which they said we can not adjust sweetness in that drink and it was also too sweet for me. But I would love to come back and try a hot tea here one day instead.","208":"Get the Okinawa milk tea!!! Because it's so good. I think Okinawa is just brown sugar. My friend says it's very similar to the milk tea in Taiwan so I guess that's very authentic. The sweetness is perfect for me aka not too sweet.  And I really like the subtleness of the milk tea. Get the Okinawa milk tea!!!","209":"This was a must place to go to when we arrived in Houston since they closed in New York City. They only offered one size of drinks for all. Amazing selection of drinks.","210":"As if Houston needs any more boba places (especially in Chinatown), a new competitor has arrived. Enter Sharetea.\n\nLike many of the modern \"boba lounges\" that are popping up around the country, Sharetea has certainly put thoughts into the decors. Well-lit interior with decent amount of sitting areas. The menus are nicely decorated and clearly labeled. Open prep stations so you can see exactly how they are making your drinks. So far so good.\n\nBut then, the drinks. We got the Classic Milk Tea and the Matcha Green Tea Crema, one safe choice and one unique choice. The classic milk tea tasted like water. I get that they lean towards more tea\/less cream but man, I could have just gotten some water and added a cup of sugar. The matcha green tea crema on the other hand tasted like cream, only. I couldn't taste any matcha flavor in drink. Worst of all, the boba themselves were kind of hard, bummer.\n\nMaybe it's just a flavor profile mismatch but this is probably the worst \"first try\" of a boba place we've ever had. Given the abundance of available options, we probably won't be back again.","211":"4.5\/5 stars! Here's a really quick run-down:\nS\/o to Jason and Kathy the best Sharetea workers B)\n\nPROS:\n+ stampcard\n+ decent prices\n+ no card minimum(!!!)\n+ you can adjust the sweetness\/ice levels \n+ free\/reliable wifi\n+ clean bathrooms\n+ incredibly friendly staff\n+ opens late on weekends\n\nCONS:\n+ can get SUPER busy on the weekends\n+ it's in Dun Huang plaza of Chinatown, so parking can be a strugglebus, and beware because if you stay for too long, you'll probably leave with bird poop all over your car T_T\n\n[AESTHETIC]\nThis place has a nice, bright, clean look with great lighting. \nThere's a variety of seating options, like smaller tables for groups of two to larger tables that can seat 4-6, as well as a bar area on both sides of the door against the windows. Because it's so bright, you can stay for hours on end without it feeling like the walls are caving in on you. \n\nThe only down side to this is that w\/light colored floors + Asians who shed hair like no other, the floors (esp in the bathroom) can get a little dirty. BUT they're pretty good about cleaning the bathroom so it's not too much of an issue (except during the weekends) \n\n[DRINKS]\nThey make their drinks on the sweeter side, which is fine b\/c you can always adjust the sweetness levels of most of the beverages. All drinks currently only come in what's typically a \"large\" size elsewhere.\nThey have some cool specialties, and one of my favorites (if I'm feeling something sweet) is the Okinawa milk tea, which is a classic milk tea with roasted brown sugar. \nOtherwise, I typically just go for the Oolong milk tea, 30% sugar, light ice. \nI've come with a variety of different groups, and they all seem to like their drinks. Only one person thought it was a life changing experience, but overall, all of the drinks were solid. I will say, however, that the creama--as much as it's a unique menu item--is not for everyone. Some think that the salty cream is too salty. \n\n[ETC.]\nWifi is reliable\/free & outlets are plenty, so if you want to get some work done during the week, it's a good place to come. Just beware because you'll probably run into some people you know throughout the day! \n\nAs mentioned, there's no card minimum, and there's a stamp card!! Compared to its rival counterparts like Kung Fu, this serves as a huge advantage. \n\nThe staff is super patient and explains menu items very thoroughly. Such happy people [':\nThey normally call out the order number, and if it's super busy, they have this cool new mic system so it's easier for both the customers and the workers. If the order isn't picked up, the workers actually go out of their way to go around and ask the customers what their order # was! And seriously they're so chill--one time my stamp card was passed in plain sight from person to person, garnering about 4 stamps for the same stamp card and they were cool with it LOL.\n\nOH and if at all possible, avoid Saturday afternoons. The line goes out the door, they run out of tapioca, and the wait time for your drink can go upwards of 45 minutes. But the fact that so many people willingly stay and wait that long says something, in my opinion. On a typical weekday, you should have no trouble finding several unoccupied tables, though, especially during the day or really late at night!\n\nFunny side story: some friends of mine visited from Austin, and one of them came 5x within a span of one week, AND he waited in that ridiculous line on a Saturday afternoon on his way back to Austin. He's seriously obsessed. We rushed over at 11:40PM the day before, and when asked, \"On a scale of 1-10 how happy are you?\" He answered \"Sharetea,\" and finished his drink within 10 minutes. (S\/o to James--tyvm for understanding my obsession with Sharetea [': )\n\n[OVERALL]\nThis is my go-to spot to hang out with friends in Chinatown! I come here way too much for my own good, but I like the vibe! I would come more to hang out than for the drinks, though. I mean they're tasty but not the most amazing boba I've ever had. But yeah I seriously come here several times a week it's unhealthy LOL \n\nI would rate it 5\/5 if it was bigger, the service faster.","212":"Nice employees in Chinatown? Am I in the Twilight Zone?\n\nNah, just Sharetea.\n\nSharetea takes their sweet time making drinks, but almost every ingredient they use is fresh, which is why I'm fine with the minor wait.\n\nI deviated from my standard order of milk green tea with pearl because roasted brown sugar intrigued me too much - I got the Okinawa Pearl Milk Tea ($4.33 including tax), and you can really taste a bit more depth in flavors than your typical bubble tea. It's borderline too sweet for me, but really, what did I expect adding more sugar to an already sweet drink...\n\nI'm definitely coming back to Sharetea to get a true assessment of their bubble tea in its purest form - the frequent buyer card (I didn't have to ask for it! The very nice employee asked me instead!) and no credit card minimum are attractive perks that make me inclined to return anyway!\n\nOh, and Sharetea takes Apple\/Android Pay. It's useless to a majority of folks, but I thought it was neat of them to invest in the technology to accept it.","213":"The most authentic Hong Kong style milk tea I have had in a LONG time! I love that they are able to custom the level of sugar.","214":"Sharetea is a very popular Taiwanese boba tea chain that recently opened here in Houston. Apparently it is the mecca for milk tea enthusiasts. Walking in, the storefront is spacious, fun and brightly lit, and of course the hangout\/study spot for college students. By brewing their own tea, Sharetea brings a unique twist to Chinatown's boba tea world. However, this brewing process can lead to slow wait times when the store gets busy.\n\nI came here with veteran Yelper Lou C to have my very first taste of a drink with creama near closing time on a week night. The tables were full with a few people on their way out and there were no lines. The staff are really helpful and friendly in answering questions. After looking at the drink menu, I ordered the matcha green tea with creama and 50% sweet. To my surprise, the drinks came out in a timely manner. When the drink came out, I could see the creama floating like a cloud on top of my drink. They gave me a cute plastic knife to cut two slits on top of the cover to be able to enjoy sipping on the creama and\/or the green tea portions. The creama is made from milk, whip cream, and some salt. For those not accustomed to creama, it could taste a little strange- creamy, frothy, rich, subtly sweet with prominent saltiness. Creama reminded me of salted caramel. I tasted the matcha green tea on its own and it had a good, strong flavor. Then, I mixed the two parts to enjoy both flavors simultaneously. Overall, I liked it but it's an acquired taste I would have to get used to after a few more visits.\n\nWith such a cute theme, \"Share the world. Share happiness,\" I would visit Sharetea again to try their different milk, fruit, and brewed teas. It provides another option in the area to meet up for small get togethers or grab some drinks to-go while you're out and about. I was too full from dinner to be able to try more of their drinks. It looks like Chinatown's shopping centers are competing to see who can have the most boba tea shops!  It would be cool to create an Iron Chef competition, but perhaps named as \"Battle of the Boba Teas\" to see which boba tea reigns supreme! One thing is for sure, you can always get your boba tea fix on almost every corner of Chinatown. What are you waiting for? Come get your happiness in a cup at Sharetea!","215":"The first comment I have to make is that the drinks in this place is super sweet. Of course the cashier told me I can choose the sweetness but if u don't know what their standard is how can I add or reduce? \n\nMy friend tried their mango slushy and he hated it, he said it takes very icy not as smooth as it suppose to be. \n\nIt's really hot so I tried their new drink with aloe add on. Suppose to be very refreshing but because it was so sweet, I really can't feel the refreshment in it. \n\nFor the ambience: I do like clean design they have and since they don't get extremely busy they are usually not very crowded and noisy.","216":"I ordered a mango green tea, half sugar less ice, with mini boba and aloe vera.\n\nThey didn't make it half sugar. So I asked them to remake it. The person at the front said he's not allowed to remake drinks so I have to ask for the manager. So I ask for the manager, who gives the OK to remake the drink.\n\nSo the drink is remade but with NO ice, so now I have a lukewarm artificially-tasting mango drink with mini boba and aloe vera. I understand that a lot of the places in the U.S. can't afford to use real fruits\/fruit pulp to make their drinks like they do in Taiwan, but Sharetea could attempt to source their syrups from a higher quality provider.\n\nAltogether a really unpleasant experience at Sharetea.\n\nI won't come back here. There are so many other amazing boba places I could go in Houston, that are SO MUCH BETTER, I'd really rather not spend my time and money here.","217":"This shop from Taiwan has been popular since it opened up by all the fierce competition in Chinatown. I tried their standard milk tea, brown sugar tea, and one with the cream top. The boba itself was chewy and well made, the drinks on the other hand were very sweet. The cream top on the drinks was disgusting. The smell was similar to spoiled milk and tasted just as bitter. I gagged. The atmosphere was nice, no loud music but I guess you would substitute that with loud Asians. It was crowded, with a line out the door and very little seating. Only one wall to the left of the place had tables and chairs so don't expect to find a study spot or hangout spot here, especially on the weekends.","218":"This place is pretty good! But the wait is SO LONG. Every new place is pretty slow but progressively gets faster\/better wait time the longer it's in business so hopefully that happens here.\n\nMy BF and I ordered the matcha fresh milk and mango green tea with no bubbles. Both were GUUUUD. I love matcha\/green tea anything.\n\nThe only down sides to this place: long line + long wait after you place your order AND they put wayyy too much bubbles in your drink if you get it. (My friend got bubbles in her's.)\n\nPlus sides: new hangout spot?, you can control the sweetness level of your drink, and lots of variety of flavors :)","219":"Initially when they first opened I tried something like passion fruit green tea and was not amazed at all. But they told me to go back and give it another try after opening week so I did recently. \n\nI ordered a jasmine green tea with tap but ended up with a jasmine milk tea, but I was craving a green tea so I was a bit upset when it was messed up. They were busy so if you're looking to get in and out, this isn't the place for it, plus the line didn't move as fast as I'm used to. They offered to fix it but they used the last bit of tapioca they had for my drink so i didn't want it to be boba-less lol. The drink itself wasn't bad but I didn't really taste a strong tea flavor which I like (especially from Taphouse).\n\nI do like how you can select the sweetness level as well as ice here. I'm looking forward to coming back to try it at least 2-3 more times but as of now it's just alright. I also really like the consistency of the tapioca here so that's a plus!","220":"Just drop all the other tea places in Houston and COME HERE!\n\nThis is seriously my favorite bubble tea place now.  Move over Kung Fu Tea, I found a better (and nicer) place that's right around your corner for me to spend my money on.  \n\nMy favorite here is their Oolong milk tea.  The flavor and freshness of this tea is amazing!  I've also tried their QQ Happy Family tea, which is awesome as well.  There are 5 different mixtures in this drinks and seriously made my mouth happy.  I've been meaning to try their creama-style because I've heard \"it's like eating 1000 calories when you take a sip.\"  Heck! With that said, I want one now!  We all know that the best thing to eat\/drink are the ones super unhealthy for you (think butter).  Anyway, this place provides you with a stamp card as well and the service here is great.  There are spaces for students to study and so far, it's clean.","221":"I LOVE Sharetea, and I've been to my fair share of boba places. I love that they pretty much started the crema (sea salt cream) trend in Houston, and theirs is still the best you can get. You can customize ice and sugar level, and they're pretty speedy when it comes to making drinks. This is definitely my favorite place in Houston for milk tea! \n\nGet the mango green tea crema! You won't regret.","222":"Yeah like always its great. I mean come on they were playing some rick ross and some Migos. Caught me for a loop haha. The tea is great though. Pretty sweet if you have 100 sugar.","223":"UPDATE: They now have a P.A. system so that you can hear your order number more easily! It's awesome how they strive to continually improve their service here! Menus have also been updated!\n\nBoba!!!! This place is comparable to KungFu and TeaBar and with all of these taphouses in the same plaza that's hard to say. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was how nice the interior was. Very open and it promotes a environment where you can just relax with a couple of friends. The staff is really friendly and the service is really fast! The staff goes out of their way to make sure you get the right drink, recommending many different drinks when I asked. The drinks are so good! I got the Okinawa Pearl Milk Tea and it is actually out of this world! I definitely recommend giving this place a shot and I see this being on the map in the upcoming months!","224":"Been here more times than needed. As my first yelp review, this was an easy one. My go to is their mango green milk tea, 1\/2 sugar. Sounds weird, but Sharetea manages to pull of the perfect combination of fruitiness and milk tea flavor. Super impressive! Today, I tried the passionfruit slush to change things up a bit. Great flavor and super refreshing for a hot day in Houston.","225":"I use to like going to this place, and when I ordered the wintermelon tea, I don't know if the cashier was new or not, but he told me that it wasn't tea and it was just water. Don't go here for false advertisement. It's not worth it. I would go somewhere else for better drinks","226":"I recently moved to Houston from Seattle and lived near the University of Washington, where there was also a huge battle between the bubble tea shops. However, once Sharetea came along, it was all over. It seems like Sharetea is going to be the king in Houston's Chinatown.\n\nIf you're a bit hesitant to try this place out, here are just a few facts that separate Sharetea from the other bubble tea shops. For one, they use fresh milk instead of using a pre-mix powder that some of the other stores have. If you don't like bubble tea because you think it's kind of chalky, you have to try this place out. Other bubble tea places also make their boba ridiculously hard and difficult to chew on (looking at you Kung Fu Tea). Sharetea cooks it to the optimal chewy-ness and actually has flavor so that you don't feel like you're just eating rubber balls. If you also haven't tried it yet, the mini-boba are also really good!\n\nMy go to flavor is Taro, and they made it just how I remember. The consistency and quality is what makes this place great.\n\nAgain, it may be nostalgia and having good memories back in Seattle, but I still stand that the quality of the bubble tea at Sharetea makes it my favorite in all of Chinatown.","227":"Let me just say I don't like matcha. Maybe matcha kit kits on a random day, but that's it.\n\nMy friend tried Sharetea in Toronto and claimed this place is hands down his favorite due to the Matcha Red Bean drink. He is a boba enthusiast so I had to try out the drink regardless of my personal preference! \n\nWhat. The. Heck. The drink is AMAZING!!! I ordered half sugar so I'm not sure how it is with regular sugar, but oh my god. There definitely is a strong matcha flavor yet the mixture with the red bean at the bottom made the drink so satisfying! Some bitter with a hint of sweetness from the red bean, the drink is a good balance. \n\nThis may be my gateway drug to matcha land.","228":"i always get the handmade taro fresh milk, which is made with fresh \"real\" taro rather than taro-flavored powder and is delicious with taro bits in every sip! i love it and believe that all taro fans shall love it as well!  Topping wise, I would pick egg pudding because I don't like tapioca pearls, and also that the silken pudding and the irregularly-shaped taro bits contrast well together!","229":"Great open space and plenty of tables to sit. They have WiFi and a printer for anyone to use, great place for students who enjoy noise in the background. Many choices to choose from the menu from hot drinks, teas and milk teas. Can adjust sweetness to you liking they do have other options if you don't like tapioca pearls. Line can get long inside,but it's worth it in the end.  Parking can be a hassle but there are parking garages the public can use.","230":"Sharetea is definitely on the come up. There's already a good amount of teahouses in this area but Sharetea has something unique and different. The \"creama.\"\n\nIts an interesting creamy topping added on top of whatever drink you'd like. I can't pin point exactly what it tastes like, but its heavy and not sweet.. which I dig. The drink also comes with a plastic baby knife so that you can cut little slits into the cup top and sip lightly from the top. \n\nTapioca here is excellent. Not sticky and clumpy, but perfectly cooked. Also tried their regular milk tea. YUM!","231":"The hype is real. Tons of tapioca places on Bellaire but this one happens to be \"new\". Been a couple times to give this place more chances but it's not that great. The milk tea options are very chalky. Came back another time to get a \"recommended\" drink and it was like powder. Service can be a hit or miss.","232":"Mango green tea with milk cap is good however they didnt mind size and ask about it. Besides, i dont like almost the decoration in sharetea room. Its not beautiful and awsome as my country. In my country, decoration is beautiful and it has up to 3 or 4 floors, on the top you can also see the city with clear roof","233":"Creama green tea with tapioca is the only thing i've ever gotten from here and it's not bad! Don't know how you're \"suppose\" to drink it but my friend told me to stab it at the very edge of the top, sip some foam then drink the drink! \n\nPassion fruit green tea my friend got was an overwhelming amount of passionfruit and we couldn't even drink it. We sadly ended up throwing it away. My other friend said his oreo was pretty good, so i guess. \n\nI come here every so often when i'm in the area when i'm playing pool upstairs but i wouldn't be like \"hey! i wanna go to sharetea!\"","234":"Yay I'm glad this Taiwanese chain made it here \n\nMy favorites are: \nBlack milk tea\nOkinawa milk tea: delish. They don't add any extra sugar to the roasted brown sugar. \n\nA crema is where they pour the milk over the tea and don't mix it.\n\nI personally prefer kung fu. I asked my friend why she liked sharetea better and she thought that it had a stronger tea taste. And then I realized that I liked the milkier taste of KF.","235":"The environment is very clean and nice inside. I only tried one drink so I can only speak for that one. I had the grapefuit yogurt slushy with aiyu jelly and I thought it was pretty good if you want something refreshing. I like how the size is pretty decent for the price. It's bigger than a regular you would get else where. The service was excellent. After each customer ordered, she reviewed the order with the customer to confirm the item that they ordered. There are many interesting drinks on the menu that I would be open to come back and try!","236":"This has become one of my favorite places to stop by and grab a drink. I really like their yakult drinks, their mango green tea and mango & passion fruit green tea as well as their classic black tea and taro milk tea. Their boba is always on point; soft, easy to chew, slightly sweet and they always give a generous amount.\n\nI've been here quite a few times and I've never had to wait long for my drinks. The service here is always welcoming and friendly which is probably another reason why I don't mind coming back so much haha.","237":"This place is really cool. Walking in, the space is really open and the ambience is very lively. It's a great place to hang out and talk with friends. It's usually crowded, but there is a reasonable amount of seating. The service is also great; the people behind the counter are super nice!\n\nI've gone two times so far, and I've gotten the Hokkaido Milk Tea and the Green Milk Tea. The Hokkaido is really sweet; it tastes like dessert, but that's probably because of the caramel toffee flavor in it. I really enjoyed it; the sweetness wasn't too overwhelming. The Green Milk Tea was more standard, but it tasted really good too. I'd say it's as good or even better than Kung Fu Tea's (the tastes are different though so there can be a comparison). The tapioca itself is also good; it's very easy to chew and pretty soft.\n\nOverall awesome place (and they take credit card for any amount order!), and I'll definitely come back because they have a stamp sheet system (every drink is a stamp)!","238":"Oolang tea tasted too classic and boring.  Had some bitter bite to the end but not too bad.  It's better than Kung Fu which is lousy.","239":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! (yes all caps because it's so good) Sharetea is my favorite bubble tea place in the US. Yes you will have to wait at peak hour but it's so worth it. \nAll of their tea can be custom to your likeness of sweet and ice level. The drinks here are pretty consistence and their boba is chewy with just an enough amount of sweetness. My favorite are the Okinawa and Hokkaido the sad thing about these is they're just so damn addictive. If you live near Houston area then you must give Sharetea a try, your waistline would not like it but it's so worth it. \n\nCheers","240":"Trying out this place for the first time to see what all the hype is about.  First of all expect to wait at least 15 minutes for drinks regardless of how many drinks you order.  There is only 1 person taking orders and probably 4 people making drinks.  Second of all, they don't take call in orders so yes you have to wait in line.  Third of all, the lady at the register was not knowledgeable about the drinks.  I ordered the honey milk tea with big boba and herb jelly and the mango green tea creama w big boba and a classic green milk tea with herb jelly and big boba.  The honey milk tea has no taste at all; it was just bland and I think they forgot to add the honey because I didnt taste any sweetness at all.  Boba was fresh and herb jelly was soft as well. Good texture on add ons.  The mango green tea creama was different.  The mango green tea was not too sweet and it had little bits of mango in it and hints of green tea.  The cream was all on the top of the cup and you had to get one of these little knives and cut a slit on top of the cup to slip the cream.  The cream was good nice and fluffy but it is too much extra work to have to sip it separately.  The classic green milk tea was eh ok nothing great about it or nothing stood out about it.\n\n\nBeen a regular at this place and I am changing my review from a 3 star to 4 stars.  The fresh taro was on point; not too sweet, it had the right texture and definitely fresh.  After coming here so frequently I have not had bad tapioca ; always fresh soft not the left over hard tapioca.","241":"The milk teas here are easily some of the best in Houston.  I highly recommend the Okinawa pearl milk tea.  You can actually taste each ingredient they put in it, it's that fresh! There is sometimes a short line to place your order, and the place can get full quick.  Surprisingly, they are able to serve your drink relatively quickly for the amount of customers they receive.","242":"my favorite tap place in Houston!\n\nfaves include\nmango green milk tea with no added sugar and herbal jelly\nOkinawa milk tea (although ive been straying away from this option because the sweetness level cannot be adjusted\nQQ milk tea with no added sugar- love all the chewy goodness","243":"Boba enthusiasts, you've come to the right spot. As soon as you step into Sharetea, you forget you are in Chinatown. The huge space that you wouldn't expect, very quiet (albeit it's a Monday afternoon) and very chic interior. I was greeted by a smiling employee who welcomed me and gave me recommendations.\n\nI wasn't sure what the creama bubble tea was but ended up ordering the classic black milk tea. Loads of boba!!! I'm talking about 3 per sip. The kind employee even gave me a sample of the creama just because he knew I never had it before.\n\nThey say they get really crowded on weekends, and I can imagine. But come by before busy time and it's a perfect study place. Lots of light, friendly atmosphere and a lot of tables.","244":"I like many fruit tea here. I don't like regular ice milk tea here but I like hot milk tea here. The ice milk tea tasted like more milk inside.","245":"Creama green tea..... too much creama, not enough tea. Good service, but not my first pick for milk tea.","246":"First review of 2017 - BOBA. \n\nThere are a plethora of boba\/tapioca shops in Chinatown. I very often see new places pop up and wonder how long they'll survive amongst the more well known shops. Sharetea is one of those newer ones, but they will have no problems surviving here. \n\nSharetea is indeed a franchise. They ship their teas directly from Taiwan daily (at least that's what they say) so you're getting fresh and delicious drinks. \n\nIt is almost always busy, so chin up buttercup YES you will probably have to stand in line next to customers that don't know what personal space is. The order\/pay line is on the left and pick up line on the right. \n\nGenerally I like sweet, but even I like to get my drinks half sweet here (the same at Kung Fu Tea). Menu can be found here: http:\/\/www.shareteahouston.com\/menu\/\n\nA few I've tried:\n*  Okinawa pearl milk tea --- Has more richness\/caramel flavor than regular milk tea \/ CANNOT adjust the level of sweetness\n*  Black \/ oolong milk tea --- 50% sweetness\n*  Creama drinks --- Rich\/buttery cream froth up top (you make a slit on the top to sip the cream and drink tea through the straw)\n\n50 cents per topping. \nWifi pw as of today still sharehappiness.\nBoba is light and on the softer side.\nNo longer accepting their stamp cards (let them know beforehand if you have a free drink). \nNo minimum on credit cards.","247":"Great fast service, no lines. I came at lunchtime in Tuesday.  I ordered the matcha red bean tea (really good) with half sugar, winter melon tea with lemon (pretty good) and blended ice cream coffee with boba for hubby. It's not blended bc there's a lump of ice or ice cream at the top....I can't tell which but I didn't try it. There's plenty of space in the place they can put tables at. Just a big empty space in the middle of the tea house. I'd come back and try more drinks. They have different flavors than other places. Prices comparable.","248":"My new tapioca place from now on! \nThey made good drink, which just perfectly fit my taste. Good quality of tea was used, I can tell! \n\nMust try the Creama and Okinawa Pearl Milk Tea! Love them!","249":"I don't really have a favorite boba place, but this place hasn't disappointed me yet. I have been here a couple times and have gotten their milk tea and some flavored fruit teas but both times I was not \"WOW!\" about it. It is good though, don't get me wrong. I would come back for it!\n\nI recently purchased their Stardust Sharetea Bottled Tea. I got the pineapple butterfly pea tea and butterfly pea tea latte. The Pineapple one tasted super fruity, pretty darn sweet and kinda candy life, while the other one tasted just like sweet milk with a hint of taro? I'm not sure what it was suppose to be. I want to get it again, due to the somewhat of the taste and how aesthetically pleasing it looks. (I mean a gradient cute tea color in a cute sharetea bottle, i mean so cute!!) but its just so darn expensive!! I don't know if this is a limited item or not, but it is worth the try if you want to spend the money...\n\nGreat place to try and get a decent milk tea! They also have other things on the menu, and a lot of my friends love this place! I need to go back and try more items and update this review later on in the future when I'm back in town!","250":"My new boba milk tea place.  I just moved to Houston area from SoCal, where I was spoiled with great boba milk tea, and my parents are in Sugar Land.  Sharetea has the focus on Taiwanese quality tea that I am looking for.  This location is difficult for parking, and it has no other food.  Not even one snack.  All they have are drinks, but the drinks are decent.  I was also looking for internet access for my mobile office needs to wait out the traffic before heading back to Clearwater, and it looks like internet and outlet is working here.  Two checks makes for the best I can do in Houston.\n\nYou might be interested to know that this place smells like taro when you walk in.  The Juice Box across the parking lot smells like mangoes.  If I weren't allergic to mangoes that juice would be so bomb!","251":"Every time I pass this place the line is always pass the door. \n\nOrdered the mango and passion fruit green tea with $50% sugar. My friends and I waited for about 15minutes for our drinks, which is okay, since the line was long. My tea was still on the sweet sidefor me (will ask for less sweet next time). But it definitely quenched my thirst. My only tiff is that it seems like all the milk teas are similar to each other, and there's no exotic flavors like rose or lavender.","252":"This just popped up out of nowhere. I never heard of it until a friend mentioned it to me. You just can't keep up with all these boba cafes opening up in China town. There's so much competition as they're all close to each other. Expand out of this China town! I want to get these closer to my home lol. \n\nIt's a good thing I can drive here to get a quick milk tea and other flavored teas. I wasn't able to get mini boba at the time because they didn't have any in stock. Hopefully the next time I go I will be able to get it. \n\nI tried their Okinawa milk tea with boba and aloe vera. It was pretty sweet and refreshing. It seems to taste closer to mocha. I'm going to try to taste all their flavors to find what is best. I did have a boba addiction for the last few months so I'm cutting back. All this sugar and carbs do add up!\n\nOverall, this place has many flavors to choose from and you can adjust your drink such as the sweetness level, ice level, and so on. So make it how you like it and enjoy that drink!","253":"As one of the newest tea places in c-town, I knew I had to experience first hand what they had to offer. When I walked in after dinner, the place was already packed. The interior was pretty roomy, and the design was simple, but very appealing to be at. \n\nI ordered the ice cream green tea with boba, and to be honest, I don't think I'd get it again. While the boba itself was sweet, the ice cream just stuck to the bottom, so it was very hard to get it to homogenize with he rest of the drink. Additionally, just trying to suck at the ice cream wouldn't get it up the straw. Despite this, when it did finally mix, it had a very creamy, refreshing, and heavy taste to it. I also tried some of my friend's Taro Pearl Milk Tea, and I gotta say it was good. It wasn't overly sweet, and the taro wasn't overpowering. \n\nService was also top notch. The cashier was super nice and helpful, and I really enjoyed both having options for the amount of ice and the sweetness. That being said, it did still take me about 20 minutes to get my drink, but maybe after the opening it'll die down a bit.  I'll definitely be coming back to sample more drinks. \nService 4\/5\nDrinks 4\/5\nAmbience 3.5\/5","254":"My only go to place ! This drink was recommended and it's good with less sweet. Without the ice , you ll get a longer lasting flavor so I would had prefer without ice. Give it a try.","255":"I thought I should update this review since I have been driving a lot of my friends away from this place with my previous review. I am actually a fan of their drinks, but the reason I gave it 2 stars before was due to the terrible wait time. I'm glad that they have improved greatly or else I would not bother updating this or coming back. My opinion on the drinks I've had before have not changed. If you want a detailed review, then read my previous one. They taste very similar to Kung Fu Tea, so if you want a cheaper alternative then this is your place.\n\nDrink recommendations: mango green tea, QQ happy family milk tea, and milk green tea","256":"Lots of flavors, gives you plenty of choices and combinations for any drink that you like!\n\nThere's lots of seating, great for groups and get-togethers!\n\nThe last time I went, I had the Okinawa drink, very sweet but very good at the same time! The boba has the right texture, and is chewy enough where it's not annoying to continuously chew.\n\nWould definitely come back again! Bring some friends along with you too!","257":"On the way home from a road trip and decided to stop by here. There were so many boba shops around to choose from. However, this place was a good choice. I got the matcha green tea creama with boba. I taste the cream a little bit more than I do the matcha. At other places the matcha can leave a weird feeling on your tongue but this drink doesn't do that! The shop is clean and the staff are nice and patient","258":"I enjoyed the milk teas and the tapioca balls, but I am not a fan of the creama tea. The creama tea is too unique tasting for me. I quite like that they have different types of milk teas to choose. Customs can also choose the sugar level. The place is spacious. Parking can be difficult at busy times, but it doesn't hurt to walk off the calories and park a little further away!","259":"The place looks minimal. Got the Hawaiian fruit tea, 50% less sugar. The sugar level was good since I don't like very sugary drinks. But I would try one of their other drinks if I come back again","260":"I had high hopes for Sharetea. I followed them on Instagram months before the location opened and anticipated to try another great boba place. We came in on a Wednesday evening, the crowd was steady and there was no wait line, but the cashier informed us it would still be about 10 minutes for our 2 drinks. I ordered oolong milk tea with less ice in hopes that the ice does not water down the drink. I felt that my drink was extremely watered down. There was no tea aroma. Pretty disappointed. There was a generous amount of boba in my drink, which is good. But I prefer my boba to be a bit chewier. My friend got the Hokkaido milk tea. It was alright. Too sweet for my taste. \n\nMaybe they had a bad night. I will most likely go back again to give it another shot, but my first impression did not blow me away.","261":"service was slower than I would expect, but I am fine with that.  The service is above average.  Here's the process:\n\n1) You pick your drink\n2) They ask you if you want tapioca\n3) Then they ask you about your sugar level.... (diabetics, this will keep you in check!)\n\nI ordered the classic milk tea as is and was happy, it verged on not to sweet and not to tart. Wish I knew about the smaller tapioca but the default ones were great.\n\nThe added attention to detail makes this place one notch above KungFu, in my opinion.  So if you want something nice be patient.  Or if you really want to see slow, go check out the 24\/7 sbux here in Houston.","262":"I decided to updagtea my previous post because they improved a lot since their grand opening. Their drinks are made at a much faster pace, and their customer service is always consistent and nice. Sometimes their sweetness consistency changes a lot but I don't mind too much. Tbh I only drink their classic green tea because I don't like anything else but my sisters like the creama green tea. But I love love love their egg pudding. \n\nJust today I got my wisdom teeth removed and so I decided to grab a container and asked them to fill it with egg pudding for me so I can eat it. It was a strange request but they were super understanding and I think I might do it again because I love their egg pudding so much. There was one time were they misheard my order and they were really nice about fixing it for me too. This is one of my go to store for drinks now.","263":"My favorite place to get bubble tea.  They stay open late, the tapioca in my tea is cooked just right, and the taste is on point.","264":"Finally they're open! \n\nI got matcha red beans milk tea with boba. So far i really like it. The cashier was very helpful and friendly. You can request the sweetness level too. \n\nI will definitely come back when i really crave for boba drinks.","265":"First time I came I tried their milk tea creama, and I've been getting that ever since. To some it tastes very odd, but it tasted like salted cream to me. It reminded me of the sea salt coffee from 85 degree bakery in California. \n\nThe juxtaposition of salty vs. sweet milk tea, and cold cream vs. warm drink (if get it without ice), is very interesting. I'm not a fan of sweet things, so I'm glad there's a kick to it to keep things interesting.","266":"This is one of the tea joints in Chinatown. I've been a couple times with my friends to have boba milk tea and chat. It's not a bad place to hang out but I just don't think that the boba milk tea is good there. First you have to specify to put fresh milk in your milk tea. Otherwise they would put the artificial cream or whatever thing they use in it and it's nasty to me (and fresh milk costs more). I normally order black milk tea and their black tea lacks aroma and the flavor of tea. It tastes like the milk and tea are not mixed well in harmony. My all time favorite tea joint in Houston is golden oolong and this place is not comparison to me. They do have something that gold oolong doesn't have, the cream top thing that my friend really likes. I don't really care for it. \n\nOverall to me drinking milk tea is special thing since I am so sensitive to caffeine that I shouldn't drink more than once a week. Thus I want it to be really good otherwise I would just want to throw it away (it's what I did with theirs). Unfortunately I am giving three stars to this place because the other places are worse like kungfu tea and Gongcha. They don't even offer fresh milk with milk tea! I used to like the milk tea In Xiong's cafe. It has been a while and I don't know how things are over there now. Anyway it's kind of sad that Chinatown doesn't have an mind-blowing boba milk tea place or maybe I am just too particular.","267":"I can after lunch so there the line was to the door, and we knew that there was probably a long wait. It took probably 10-15 minutes until we were able to order and maybe 5ish more to get our drinks. I'd say, they were really efficient. \n\nI had the classic green milk tea with boba with 100% sweetness. The drink itself is really good and has more of a tea flavor to it, so I can understand how busy the place is. My only complaint is that the boba is really soft, if it was better, I would definitely have given a five star. \n\nThe mango green milk tea is really good as well, with pur\u00e9e mango texture and sweetness you could taste. This drink I've never seen at any other boba places, so it's nice to try something with good results.","268":"Ordered: Milk Green Tea\n\nShort line (thank goodness), Green milk tea was a little sweeter than usual but it's ok i still managed to drink the whole thing.  \n\nQuestion remains...would I go back. Sure i'll prolly try and get out my comfort zone and order something outside the norm.","269":"What the heck did I order? I always enjoy creamy, milky drinks, but this was like drinking heavy whipping cream. I ordered the matcha crema, since I usually love matcha drinks and creamy drinks, but this did not work out. After mixing the cream into my drink, it became very viscous and left a \"cold butter on your tongue\" feeling, which was uncomfortable. Every 5 minutes, I'd notice that the cream would rise back to the top, and I wouldn't be able to decide whether or not to mix the drink again due to how heavy it was. I cannot stress how thick and gloppy the drink was! I would not recommend it to anyone, despite how much that person loves matcha or creamier drinks.\n\nI also tried their original milk tea and didn't find it special.","270":"Only recently heard about this place and when a friend came into town, why not take the opportunity to visit? Plus, I heard of lines, so it had to be good, right?\n\nI love milk tea and boba. I just don't get them as much as I'd like due to the caloric content of one of these babies. Having said that, I generally love the original flavored milk tea and this place seems to have a number of milk teas that only differ by the type of sugar used to sweeten them. After reading some reviews, I decided that I must try the Okinawa (roasted brown sugar) and my hubby got the Hokkaido (caramel toffee) to get something different. We almost got the Ginger, though. You get the choice of choosing your sweetness level and how much ice you want as well as any additions like pudding for an additional .50 cents, but do note that there is only one default sweetness to both the Okinawa and Hokkaido, but we could limit the ice. There also seems to be one standard size for the drinks. ...this was after we stood in line for around 15 minutes on a Saturday night at roughly 9 pm. Not too bad, but then you realize that after you place your order, you get a number and need to wait a little more for the drinks themselves.\n\nThe establishment is fairly large with tables and chairs and way too many people. Thankfully, our friend made it there early and snagged an entire table for us. A good thing: we were a party of 8. There was cute wall art on the walls, but despite the large number of customers milling around (some even brought laptops and were working while others were there just to chat), there were only 2 people making drinks. Ah, that explains the lines, then.... in addition to some invisible hype I was not privy to.\n\nWhen we finally got our drinks around 5 minutes or so after we sat down (our numbers were announced, but depending on how distracted you are at the time and how many people are there that may affect noise levels, it can be missed so keep your ears alert). Despite how I couldn't choose the sweetness level, both drinks weren't too sweet (dare I say that it was just right?), which is a major plus. There were also definite flavor differences. I quite liked the Okinawa. Though it didn't have as strong a tea taste as I've had before, there was a definite tea flavor, so they get a passing score from me on that. The added dimension of the brown sugar was good. However, for the Hokkaido, I strangely also got undertones of coconut. Coconut? Yes, coconut. Both hubby and I didn't like it as much; I sort of wish I got the ginger instead. They aren't stingy with the boba, so that was good as well. \n\nI usually feel pretty full after drinking a full cup of these bad boys (read: milk teas with tapioca), but that was not the case here. However, I did make three trips to the bathroom from all that tea content, since tea is a natural diuretic. I suppose this means they use a good amount of real tea. Overall, I like the flavor (nothing overpowering, though I'm still not sure about that coconut) and the flavor profile is there. They use what they say they do!\n\nNext time, I'm curious about their ginger, taro, and matcha. I wonder if they use real taro as opposed to powder flavorings. I guess only time will tell. They do offer stamp\/loyalty cards, which is nifty, because I'm one of those people who will return to get my card stamped. \n\nWith the place being so popular, the cleanliness outside was decent, but far from perfect. There were bits of straw wrappers on the floor and the trash can was overly full in that people started to line their ups on the countertop next to the trash can. Of course, this was shortly before they closed (yes, we stayed that long) so perhaps they were waiting until the last customer left before they tended to it. The restroom was (barely) passable. No toilet paper was installed on the dispenser; a half-used roll was laying on the floor and another partially used roll was propped on the dispenser. Sheets of paper towels were scattered on the floor. At least they still had soap and had paper towels in their respective dispensers.\n\nAll in all, I would like to try a couple of their other non-milk tea offerings before I make a final decision on their drink selections. Thus far, drinks are good, though I'm still not sure why the place has lines. It's good, but not that good. Perhaps my next trip will give me something that'll blow my socks off! Only time will tell...","271":"Plenty of tables, plenty of outlets, and decent tea.\n\nI liked their honey lemon tea. They put a whole lemon in it! Different. \n\nTapioca here is good, not clumpy. \n\nFree wifi, never went out while I was studying there for 6+ hours.\n\nSometimes it smelled weird in there. Studying there, you'll get used to it, but still. It was funky.","272":"sharetea is my favorite boba place and i highly recommend. the milk tea is an acquired taste but after trying more than once, you'll grow to love it! i recommend the mango green tea with aloe vera, and the winter melon with fresh milk if you're looking for something different to try! but if you want to try something more classic, try the honey milk tea with pearls or the okinawa milk tea with pearls, my boyfriend loves it. some sharetea drinks are inconsistent in taste but most likely because of the change in barista, but overall it's still very tasty and worth the try! i live 40 minutes away form this location and sometimes i go down to bellaire just for sharetea!","273":"ShareTea is average compared to all the other milk tea in Bellaire. It has nothing to differentiate itself. Their milk tea and their offering is standard. If you're looking for a fast boba place, this place is the go to because it's definitely not as crowded as Kung Fu Tea or Gong Cha.","274":"So to be honest, my first few experiences of Sharetea weren't that great but today they absolutely nailed it. I tried the Okinawa and it has a sublime rich brown sugar undertone that just makes your day. The oolong milk tea is simple and executed to perfection too. Wouldn't mind slightly firmer boba but the tea itself is more than good enough to bring you to 5 stars.","275":"Parking: May be an issue as it is located in a busy and popular shopping center. If you are lucky you can find a parking spot right in front of Sharetea. If you can't find one, there are two parking garages where you can park and walk over. \n \nTime and Day: Came on a Wednesday at 8:30 PM. There was not a lot of people in line but as I waited for my drink, the line fluctuated from maybe 2 people to 6 people ordering a drink. Since this place is new and popular, there is most likely going to be a line here. \n\nFood: I ordered an Oolong Tea Creama with tapioca ($4.80) and it was above average. Along with giving you a straw, you get a small knife that you can use to cut a small opening at the top. You can either sip at the cream to drink it separately from the oolong tea or mix it all together. I mixed a little of the cream into the tea and didn't like it as much because it had a strange taste. I preferred to drink the tea and sip on the creama alone. Overall, the drink gets a 3.5\/5. On a side note, you can customize your drink by changing the amount of sugar and ice. \n\nService: Very basic service. You ordered your drink at the cashier and you wait as they call your number. Service gets a 3\/5. \n\nPrice: $4.80 for the oolong tea creama with tapioca wasn't worth it to me. Seems a little bit too pricy for very little gain with the creama.  \n\nOverall: Sharetea brings some unique drinks (creama and Yakult) to Bellaire and it is always nice to have more competition with all the tapioca places. However, the creama drink did not win me over as a fan. I may stop by to try one of the milk teas so that I can compare with it other locations to determine if it is better than the other tapioca locations. Overall, this place gets a 3\/5.","276":"The black milk tea is meh... the milk\/creamer is weird. They serve drinks hot and with tapioca too!","277":"I'm always on the search for delicious boba and this place definitely became one of my favorites. I got their Hokkaido milk tea and it was so delicious. I was scared to get it at first because it said it has caramel and toffee. Usually flavors like that overpower the milk tea essence and it feels like you're drinking coffee or eating chocolate. I was so surprised when I took my first sip at how delicious it was. It remained true to its milk tea roots but has a delicious undertone of Carmel and toffee richness. I will be coming back for this delicious drink and am excited to try what else their menu has to offer.","278":"This is one of my new favorite place for tapioca ! They have their unique drink called creama and its like condense version of whipped cream on top of the drink. They give you an option of drink cream part and drink separately but I like to mix and drink it. So far I've tasted mango juice with yakult, Cocoa creama, Matcha green tea creama, and black tea creama. I like the matcha green tea creama the most!","279":"Greeted with a welcoming smile from Kathy, she was helpful in getting my order correct and repeated it back which was great to ensure it would come out the way I wanted.\n\nJason went above and beyond my expectations as it's accustomed for customers to pick up the drink but he hand delivered the drink upon making it!\n\nMango Green Milk Tea is the way to go (Sharetea orders everything from Taiwan so it's legit). Although Sharetea's drinks are for sure too sweet (personal preference), the sweetness level is easily adjustable (0%, 30%, 50%, 80%, 100%, 120% - asking for diabetes). And being in Chinatown, customer service expectations can be pretty low but Sharetea knows that sharing is definitely caring.","280":"I would give them ZERO is there's an option! Totally awful service! I ordered a hot drink, however, he gave me a cold one and said its already been made and couldn't be changed! With an attitude! If you can't satisfy a customer, please do not choose to be a server! Absolutely AWFUL! I would not come back again!","281":"Fairly good milk tea! The place is very cute. The milk tea kind of remind me of Kim's tea house milk tea but much better. I also tried the Okinawa milk tea and it tasted roasted\/a bit burnt? But it wasn't bad. It taste just like a regular milk tea but more stronger in flavor and basically roasted cuz they use roasted brown sugar for the drink lol. The matcha red bean was nothing to rave about. Wasn't gross but I literally could not detect any matcha and the red bean just takes over the whole drink so I feel like that's all I'm drinking. Honey lemon tea is super super sour. The herbal jelly is gross, it was mushy and soft for some reason and not jelly-like. The only thing is that it takes longer than it should to get one drink when it's not busy and they literally have about 5 people at the register and the staff is not so friendly","282":"Employees here are always rude. They also get pissed at you if they mess up your order and half ass the fixed order. \n\nI've come here several times and each time, no greetings just stares and when they take your order they sound really annoyed. Didn't mind it everytime for the past 2 yrs i've been coming here and i even still decide to tip 15% everytime but a few weeks ago the whole place was packed but my two friends and i were the only table visited and told that they were closing in 15 minutes. There were lots of loud conversations, and we were speaking in a lower volume. I mind the time and always try to leave before closing but I know a lot of places the manager doesn't allow their employees to announce closing until the exact moment or actually 15 minutes afterward.\n\n****Tonight, my boyfriend and i ordered and as we waited i noticed on the receipt, my boyfriend's matcha crema had the wrong sinker. I went up and told the cashier and the cashier told the person making the drink before she even topped off the crema, but she topped it off anyway after hearing the mistake and said it was too late right after. They stared me down while finishing off and sealing off the drink and called my order, and to my disbelief they apparently weren't going to correct it. So i again ask if they were going to fix my order. They told me if they replaced the sinker the crema would get mixed up. I don't understand how they thought it was acceptable to not take responsibility for their mistake and asked to make a new one since they messed up. They looked pissed and reluctantly started making a new one. Now i've had the matcha crema several times the past few years i've come here and this one tasted so much more bland than all the others and was evidently much lighter before mixing the crema. They obviously didn't want to own up to their mistake and made the drink below the standard quality. I'm sorry but there are way too many teahouses in chinatown and all over houston to settle for terrible customer service. \n\nCremas are good, everything else on the menu is okay. Their fruit teas are really sweet and i'm not a huge fan of the pulp.","283":"Came here because of the hype, so I definitely had to try this place for myself. I am not entirely sure why, but most of these Taiwanese tapioca places have really rude cashiers that seem as if they really don't want to help assist you nor be friendly... \nThe milk tea is pretty decent though. \nNothing special about this tapioca place.. I guess it is hyped up because of how new it is.. But overall, real mundane. \nMy friend wanted Thai tea, but they did not have it here also.. Lol.","284":"I highly recommend this place! There was a lot of people and a long line. A long line means good quality so I expected a lot. I looked at the menu and I really wanted to try everything. They even have ice cream as a topping! I love their mini boba! I got the matcha green tea creama! It was amazing! I finished it so fast that I ordered another drink. The cashier told me to try the fresh milk taro with taro bits. I also added pudding. It was a very good drink. I love this place. I would rank this place as one of the top boba places in Houston!","285":"I definitely enjoyed finding a tapioca place that freshly brewed their teas.  I did come here with a friend who doesn't like tea so perhaps this isn't the place if you don't like tea based beverages.  Or you could have a change in perspective!\n\nI ordered the Passion Fruit Green Tea with tapioca and definitely enjoyed it!  The drink wasn't too sweet and the tapioca pearls were very chewy.  I also ordered the Milk Black Tea with tapioca and it was surprsingly really good! The tea isn't too strong but you can tell that it is good quality tea. \n\nThis is a cheaper place in comparison to Kung Fu Tea and Class 502 and has the same quality in their teas! It's really bright in the building and there are plugs and WiFi so always a plus for a student :)","286":"This is the best bubble tea place in Houston, hands down. \n\nSharetea has a huge variety of drinks that all seem to be very good (n=8 different drinks or so). You can tell that the drinks here are made with very fresh ingredients and high-quality tea - I would swear to this in a blind taste test if I could. \n\nThe quality of the toppings is especially top-notch, most of all the boba - I've never had pearls with such a great texture before. The best part is that Sharetea gives you HUGE servings of boba, allowing you to enjoy as much of the goodness as possible.\n\nLines can get insane on the weekends, but the service is friendly and very efficient (you will spend more time waiting in line to order than waiting for your drink after you've placed it). There is no credit card minimum here and even the wifi is fast. If you like bubble tea, there is literally nothing wrong with this place.\n\nFor those seeking inspiration, some of my favorite drinks in no particular order include the following: Honey Milk Tea (the great taste of the classic milk tea with a honey finish), Coffee Milk Tea (for the caffeine kick), QQ Happy Family Milk Tea (for the toppings), Hokkaido Pearl Milk Tea (great \"toffee\" flavor, but a bit sweet), and Okinawa Pearl Milk Tea (roasted brown sugar is as good as it sounds).\n\nI look forward to filling up my next stamp card here!","287":"Decent teas. Hawaii fruit tea was better than the strawberry black tea. They definitely are caffeinated so good for staying awake to work\/study\/drive. \n\nDidn't get bubbles, so I can't say much about those. But the tea flavors weren't watered down & choosing your own sweetness is a plus!","288":"This is my second time here. I don't recall what I ordered last time but I didn't have a very lasting impression or anything. Today I decided to try the winter melon with fresh milk & boba, half sugar. Again, I'm not that impressed! I don't see what the hype is about; I've definitely had better boba. The milk is okay. The boba is a bit too chewy for me, but that's my personal taste. The line was long as well, so the service was a bit slow. Don't really think I'll be back.","289":"Business is located in the midst of a crazy crowded plaza with lots of boba\/tapioca options. The plaza it is a part of offers lots of parking, but during peak hours for meals\/weekends, it can get pretty crazy. So carpool if you can? :)\n\nLocation is pretty clean for the most part. Occasionally the tables may be a bit sticky from drink residue. I suppose you can get the employees to wipe it for you, if you can get them away from making the drinks. This place can have a pretty big line. There are about 8-10 tables in the place that can seat about 2-4 people. They're all move-able, so you can combine tables if there are free tables. Bathroom is generally clean, no complaints there. There is also a barstool area by the windows that can seat 3-4. \n\nThe drinks are pretty big, that's the big plus to this place. I'm not sure how I feel about their generic milk-tea, but I do enjoy a good QQ Happy Family Milk Tea. It has a lot of different items all combined into the drink: boba, grass jelly, pudding, lychee jelly.\n\nBonus: They do have a card stamping system to instill customer loyalty. The system is organized by inputting phone numbers into their payment system. \nIf you're still on their physical card system, make sure they input the right amount of stamps when they transfer over your card to the electronic system. I went from 3-4 stars to 1 when I got transferred over. :(","290":"So far I've tried their Okinawa Milktea and Mango greentea creama and they're both delicious. Not too sweet and very fresh. Definitely recommend.","291":"As many others have said this place is close competition for Kung Fu Tea which is in the same shopping center. Both places have kinda rude staff with KFT having this flamboyant Filipino guy who always gives you such sass and ShareTea having this lady who literally screams at the top of her lungs for you to come get your order. I guess that's just the norm in Chinatown though. \n\nService aside this place gets 4 stars because their drinks are amazing. You can adjust the level of ice and sugar here to your liking for each of their drinks and also choose the type of boba you want. I had the green tea crema which comes with this little plastic knife. Apparently you're supposed to cut a slit in the cup and sip the cream and drink the drink separately. But being the ditz that I am I just shook the cup up and mixed it together. Doing it that way it did taste like green tea milky deliciousness and had me craving it a few days later. Looking forward to trying other items on the menu but the long lines have been keeping me from making it back in. Remember to ask for a stamp card so you can get your free drink after buying 10.","292":"My new go-to place for tapioca in Chinatown. The prices are pretty standard for the area, but the quality is amazing! You really can't go wrong with any of the items on the menu, but my favorites are the creama drinks. It's tea mixed with whipped cream and a sprinkle of salt. It's perfect for people who don't like super sweet drinks. Try the wintermelon creama!","293":"It's always nice to come here and see people who genuinely want to help you out. The cashier was super nice and the drinks are always delicious. My partner got the summer special drink \"Lemon Yogurt Slushee\" and I got their \"Hot Taro Milk\". The lemon yogurt reminds of us of a liquid version of an Italian wedding cookie. It's not too sweet but just tart enough to make it satisfying and make us go \"ahhhhhh\" after every sip. The blend is my boyfriends definite recommendation while it's still here. The hot taro milk is mildly sweet but the flavor profile of taro is definitely there. The creaminess and the sweet mend together to make me feel all warm and cozy. I'm just about in a food and beverage coma, but you should definitely check it out and try something sometime soon!","294":"Pretty solid milk tea but slightly inconsistent.  I normally order the honey milk tea and sometimes it will be way too sweet.  The mango green tea creama tastes just like mango pudding. There's not much to say about this place that hasn't already been said.  Just a decent spot for tea cravings.","295":"Hm for me, Sharetea leaves a lot to be desired. On both occasions I've been here, the lines have gone out past the door, making me have high expectations. I've gotten the passion fruit black tea and Okinawa milk tea. Both drinks were crazy sweet - maybe that was on me, since I didn't change the sweetness level the first time. I didn't like the passion fruit seeds that floated in the first drink. They were very hard and difficult to chew. The Okinawa milk tea didn't really live up to the hype and I was disappointed when I was told it's not possible to change the sweetness level for this drink. It didn't have the depth in flavor I was looking for; to me, it tasted like regular milk tea that was simply bit darker in color. Perhaps I'm more partial to KFT but I don't imagine I'll be frequenting Sharetea for my milk tea fix.","296":"They are located in the same shopping center with FIT, Tiger Den, Class 502 rolled ice cream, Six Ping bakery and among many boba stores  next to each other.  The store faces Bellaire street.   I called and asked for directions and he said it's on Bellaire.  Duhhhh I know that!  He could have gave more detail locations.  \n\nI must say this is the best boba tea I had.  It's freshly brew tea and doesn't taste artifical.   I got the Okinawa Milk tea that so many recommended here in yelp.com.  I will be back for more.","297":"I've had boba tea from all over the country and even in Taiwan, where it originated. Sharetea has drinks that taste very similar to what you would get in Taiwan. I like that you can customize the sweetness and amount of ice that goes in your drink. This is definitely my favorite place to get boba whenever I'm in Houston!","298":"Lovely authentic Taiwanese style tapioca drinks here! Boba was originated in Taiwan, so you definitely know these guys are onto something with their concept. This cafe is small and brightly lit with many chairs and tables to situate yourself. They have WiFi and great internet connection. This is the place to be when needing to work on something online, studying or reading a book. Although it can be a little loud. But again, if you're doing some light research online or working on a simple task, I recommend this cafe over the other ones in China Town. I'm here writing this review and surfing the web. Ordered the honey milk tea with tapioca. Highly recommended. Its sweet, crisp, and has the right amount of tapioca and ice. I would probably have it sweetened a bit less next time around. Looking forward to coming back again and maybe trying the Okinawa milk tea (sweetened with roasted brown sugar). This place is almost always packed with super long lines. Luckily i'm here on a rainy Sunday evening, so it hasn't been crazy busy. But I recommend trying this place anyhow when in the area. Share tea = share happiness!","299":"The chopped chicken (fried) bento box is really good.  I drive 50 minutes to fill this weekly craving.  The tofu here and marinated eggs are incredible.  Very small place, never crowded because people just don't know how good the food is here.  The honey infused green tea will get you going.","300":"Wintermelon creama tea. Sweet, refreshing. Not heavy.\nOkinawa milk tea. Sweet, smoky after taste for first half of drink. Good amount of caffeine.\n\nWould come back for both! Good enough to try new items and trust it will be some level of deliciousness. Fast service. Looks clean. Crowded, but not a long line.","301":"So I came to check out the original location of Sharetea after seeing the one in Sugar Land, and I have to say it was interesting. The cafe is more modern looking and the place looks nice. Parking, on the hand, can be difficult especially if it's a busy day. When I parked I had to walk steps to get here. I heard from other reviews that there usually is a long line, but when I ordered there was only 1 other group in front and afterwards a whole line came in. Again, that mysterious lucky ability of mine to show up before a rush. The cocoa lovers drink I ordered here was very delicious, it was creamier and had specks of chocolate throughout unlike the one I got in Sugar Land! Pricing was ok and respectable. Though that's where the good stuff ended. This might just be me, but I don't think the rewards here and the rewards from the sugar land location coinicide. I put in my number hoping to get another point, only to find that I ended up being put in the loyalty program here. Hmm??? They also didn't accept Apple Pay at the time since apparently since it wasn't up and running so just had to use my card. Finally, about 3 hrs into the middle of the night, I got up because I had stomach cramps and pains which has NEVER happened to me before. Tried going back to sleep only to experience pain again. Was on the p for a long time. And the pains continued through the morning. Makes me question their concept of \"fresh milk\" (whether real milk or milk powder, who knows), since it was the only thing I had that night before bed. With a bunch of other boba tea options around, think I'll just stick with the sugar land location and try something else next time i'm around. However I will agree that the drinks here are MUCH better than their other location.","302":"Love this tea place, one of my favorite ones on Bellaire now since other older tapioca places have gone downhill in quality. I'm currently addicted to Akinawa milk tea with tapioca. It has a right amount of sweetness and milk.","303":"Sharetea is popular for a reason! Some of the best boba I have had in awhile. In a place where boba is everywhere, I'd recommend coming here if you don't mind a wait. They have great drink options and customization, and their boba is a perfect consistency. The location is also very modern and clean, with enough seating, strangely, for everyone who comes in.","304":"One word: amazing! Love the fresh handmade taro milk tea.  Definitely recommend to try this. The sweetness is perfect. This place is a must if you visit Houston! Everything on the menu is good. Recommendation: go during not so busy times to avoid long lines and waiting.","305":"Sunday evening about 7pm is when my friends and I dropped by to get a refreshing drink since we had been walking in the heat around the shopping center. There were about 7 people in line ahead of us so the wait was expected. I'm just not sure why it was pretty busy lol...\n\nMy friends got a ginger milk tea andddd I forgot the other drink. I got the coffee milk tea. We all ended up getting our drinks with the herbal tea because they ran out of tapioca. Quite a disappointment for me because I really like those to complement my milk tea. No big deal, I like trying new things. Except when it doesn't taste good , the flavors just didn't mesh very well... I got it because it was one of the recommended drinks as per the menu. I had a really hard time drinking it, the only reason why I didn't throw it away was because I paid for it and hate wasting things. \n\nThere are definitely MANY other choices for these kinds of drinks, especially in this huge shopping center, so I'd suggest going elsewhere to curb your sugary drink cravings.","306":"My favorite place to get drinks! I love that you can choose the amount of sugar and ice you put in your drink. They have a great variety of drinks including milk teas, brewed tea, ice blends and toppings! I enjoy the mango green tea with 80% of the sugar or the classic milk tea. Their tapioca is always perfect here! It's not too soft or hard. My brother normally gets the ice blends with ice cream. They have the mango, coffee or strawberry ice blend which all include a scoop of ice cream inside. Totally recommend this place!","307":"I passed by Share Tea several times and I have been itching to try it. However, I was not in the mood for milk teas or creamas, just wanted something flavorful and refreshing.  So I just took a shot in the dark without looking at Yelp (gasp). Tried the kiwi fruit tea, 50% sweet, regular ice. My initial impression was that this was still too sweet- should have gotten less. At the same time I was warned by the gal who took my order they run sweet, so at least they are true to their word! The drink had plenty of kiwi and really had a good consistency. Overall not bad. I will have to come in again and sample the more popular drinks. The stamp card is calling to me -it needs to get filled up to 10 to earn a free drink. How could I refuse such an offer?:)","308":"Wow this place be hopping! \n\nI was in Houston for a weekend, and we came back here twice so that must be saying something, right?\n\nThe Okinawa Milk Tea was a nice twist on the classic milk tea. It's milk tea but with ~roasted brown sugar~. Fancy, right? Unfortunately, you cannot adjust the sweetness level for this particular drink, so it is a little bit on the sweeter side but not too too sweet. \n\nBoba is right on, and I love how much they give you! \n\nSecond time I came I ordered the mango green tea creama. Creama..What is creama? Imagine a white foam floating atop your drink that is kind of sea-salty. I don't really know what's in it, but the idea is to have a sweet-and-salty kind of drink. (If you like salted caramel, you might want to try creamas). My mango green tea drink was pretty good, and I am picky when it comes to tartness. It wasn't too sweet, not too tart, and even had hints of mango chunks and fibers floating around! :o \nNow, try as you will, you CANNOT mix the creama with your drink no matter how much you swirl your fat straw. Apparently, in California, you get a knife to slit a hole on one side of your cup so you can sip the creama from the slit and then drink your drink from your fat straw getting the best of both worlds in one gulping. I unfortunately, did not receive any knife so I was drinking this the cumbersome way:  pull your straw up so that you can get some creama at the top, then push the straw back down to get your drink. Yes, it was difficult lol. \n\nI like how you can adjust your sweetness level AND your ice level too! They do have stamp cards, and there is NO credit card minimum. Also freeeee wi-fi! Now go share some tea :) Or not.","309":"Ehhh... \n\nI got the green tea matcha crema and Hubbie got the ginger milk tea. \n\nThe green matcha tea was better than the ginger milk tea. The crema was interesting. Not too sweet which was a plus.\n\nBoba pearls were a little on the hard side. \n\nThe line was long on a Saturday night but it moved quickly. \n\nGood enough, just not that great. \n\nI'd rather get Tapioca House down the street.","310":"This teahouse always seems to be busy. Not too sure why, but it is. I came in on a Sunday night around 9:40-10 PM and they were extremely packed! Line almost out the door type packed. For this reason, it took forever to get our drinks! Literally took like 15-20 mins; something I'm not used to when it comes to a teahouse.\n\nMy boyfriend got the Hokkaido milk tea with boba and I got the honey milk tea with boba. Both drinks weren't very, \"WOW,\" and anything we would return for. Not to mention that the drinks were kind of pricey too. The Hokkaido milk tea had a really strange, distinct taste to it that I can't describe. Idk...Maybe it's just us being picky...\n\nI probably wouldn't come back here for my tapioca needs. I do want to try their infamous creama one day though!","311":"Really great boba! It's the perfect consistency and so chewy.\n\nThis place is really popular right now, especially in the afternoons after lunch. To beat the rush, make sure to get there before 1pm. The line goes out the door after that. They also tend to run out of boba near dinnertime and definitely by the end of the day. Keep that in mind before waiting in line late at night only to be disappointed.\n\nI always make sure to stop by here whenever I'm in town!\n\nThey have a ton of flavors and new things to try :) It's exciting and fun.\n\nThe decor is pretty simple. Nothing impressive. The high amount of traffic and noise would discourage me from staying here very long. The furniture isn't very comfortable, either.\n\nI think the way they have the layout and format of the space is clunky. It doesn't make sense that patrons who are waiting for their drinks have to criss cross through the patrons in line multiple times to get their drinks when they come up and then to go back to the tables or to leave out the door.","312":"If you want to show that sweet tooth a good time, this is the place to be. \nIf not, order 0% sugar on your fruit teas unless you want diabetes.\n\nFriendly service! Way better than Mr. Sassy pants around the corner. :)","313":"I've been to a lot of boba shops around Houston and I'd say this place is mediocre. The boba is alright but not anything special. It kinda bothered me that they didn't have jasmine green tea, a staple at any boba place. My boyfriend got the Oreo Creme and it was too buttermilky and not enough Oreo. I probably wouldn't come back here, there are just better places to go like kung fu or gong cha.","314":"In town looking for a milk tea place. \n\nWell you can't really go wrong with share tea. Get the basic stuff like milk tea is hard to mess up \n\nTheir tapioca was pretty good. Soft and sweet. \n\nMeets expectation.","315":"LIGHT ME UP! I know that there has been a \"lightbulb tea\" craze happening in Chinatown with and I am completely on board. One thing to know about this place that I would caution someone who has not been there before is ask if they adjust the level of sweetness. I made a rookie mistake my first time going to one of these places and I almost went into a diabetic coma. It was insanely sugary to the point I actually couldn't drink it. However, here at Sharetea that's not a problem. They will gladly adjust the level of sweetness for you to where it's bearable. I hardly get any sweetener in mine personally. However, if you like it super sweet this is definitely the place for you. On my trips here I was looking to get the share tea bottles and was a little disappointed that they no longer offer it. The girl at the register said they may have it back in the fall or winter time so maybe it's just a seasonal thing. However, they did have The bubble lights Tea available. You can get the fruit flavor which has a choice of pineapple, mango or orange. Or you can get the honey lemon with aloe vera also in the bubble light. I personally got the pineapple fruit and was not disappointed. There were a little chunks of pineapple in the tea and not only was it pretty to look at but it was extremely well balanced and refreshing. It's a little on the pricey side at six dollars a pop so be forewarned. If you are in Chinatown and looking to experience tea and have a cool glass to take home with you, hit up ShareTea","316":"I got a green tea with grass jelly and tapioca with 80% sweet (they didn't have a 75% option). It was still too sweet for me. I can't imagine what it would taste like if it was 100%. I did not enjoy it very much. I should've walked around the corner to Kung Fu tea. Their 75% is perfect.","317":"Good tea! The oolong milk tea is delish, as are their yogurt slushy drinks. The grapefruit yogurt slushy is my fave! The honey milk tea is only for those with an extreme love of honey... The taste overpowers the tea, the milk, everything!\n\nMake sure they get your order right. Sometimes, they'll add in boba when you didn't ask or forget to add something. But they're not that forgiving about wrong orders, so don't go looking for stellar customer service!","318":"In terms of service and drinks it's 5\/5.\nIt's always good for me whenever I go, and I love getting milk teas from a lot of places. \nPrices are around $4-5, more than a few places but hey it's still good. \n\nFor Drinks, I'll recommend:\n\nBlack Milk tea (Can't ever go wrong with the most basic milk tea.) 4.5\/5\n\nMango Green Milk Tea (This drink caught me off-guard. The tea is nice and the mango syrup they put in makes it better. However if you don't want it too sweet take the sweetness level at around 50-80%) 4.7\/5\n\nQQ Happy Family Milk Tea (Its basically Milk Tea with a lot of the toppings. If you like the toppings in your milk tea then you should get it. But if not then go with milk tea.) 3.9\/5\n\nOkinawa Milk Tea (This Tea cannot have its sugar level adjusted, however its sweetness is just right because of the brown sugar they use. For this, it has a nice flavor to it, something people should try at least once.) 4.7\/5","319":"If I had to describe sharetea in the most concise way... \"crack in a cup.\" Once you start you can't stop. Creama = crack. I love adding aloe Vera or herbal jelly in my drinks for that extra umph.","320":"Really great boba! I got the Okinawa milk tea and supposedly it's better than just regular milk tea. The drinks come out fast and when we went there wasn't a long line (Labor Day around lunch time). a bit on the pricy side but the drinks are pretty large.","321":"Of the 10 or so boba\/teahouses in the shopping complex, this is probably my favorite and go-to places.  This location has a nice and bright interior.  On a Friday or Saturday night, this is one of the places that usually has a line, which contributes to the more than usual wait for a drink.  The prices are pretty comparable to all other drink places.\n\nI usually get the matcha green tea creama, without any add-ons.  This is probably my favorite \"boba\/teahouse\" drink, since I find the slightly salty creama is pretty tasty.  I would be cautious ordering this since I haven't heard too many compliments.  It could just be an acquired taste that I am grown accustom to. The boyfriend usually orders some kind of milk tea variety with zero to half the normal sugar level, and regular boba.  What makes this place great is the consistency of their drinks over time.","322":"With all the boba competition in the area,  this is my least favorite.   I got a grapefruit, passion fruit, and orange tea and my girlfriend got the ginger milk tea.  My tea was made completely out of syrup.  We both got our drinks half sweet and they were still overly. \n\nSave yourself the 8 dollars on boba tea and go to one of the other competitors.  This place is definitely not worth trying.  I'd give it a 1 star based on their terrible drinks, but I'll give them a little time to establish their drinks.","323":"Share tea is the best boba you can get in Houston. I've always been a fan of Teahouse, but Sharetea has won my heart. I never took the time to come when they first opened up, but better late than never! I've gotten a chance to come here multiple times and even recommended this place to friends, and they've all loved this place just as much as I do. Some of my favorites are the Strawberry Black Tea, Hawaiian Tea, and Grapefruit Tea. I like the sweetness at 100%, but they always give you the option to adjust it. The staff is also good at suggesting to reduce the sugar when they know a drink is sweeter than other, which I appreciate. Sharetea is really great about being consistent and you'll always get exactly what you want. Also, the boba here is always perfectly sweetened and chewy, unlike many boba places where its a coin toss of good chewy boba or bad mushy boba on a bad day.  I've also heard the whole lemon tea was pretty good, but they literally put a whole lemon in there and it takes up half the cup. You basically get gypped half a drink by adding an entire lemon. But, from the sips I do steal, it's pretty tasty. This place has loads of places to sit, but if you're there during busy hours, it's sometimes hard to find a place to sit; otherwise I'd be there studying all the time. Overall, Sharetea is consistent and does a good job at putting out quality boba beverages! (Also, they stopped doing a stamp card and do rewards using your phone number. Definitely an easier way to keep track of those points without losing the card all the time.)","324":"I stop by here because the tea is unique here.  After trying so many places everything feels convoluted and it all taste the same now.  I mean i enjoy the Green Tea Crema that you slice with the pick and drink it without the straw.  It's like salted green tea (instead of caramel) and i add ice cream to it.  I mean this place its good but tbh i am not the right person to give an opinion at least not anymore on milk tea.  haha sorry but they all pretty much taste the same.  this place is clean and people are nice so i guess.  The sassy guy at kung fu tea scares me (he's so mean)!","325":"This is one of my favorite milk tea places in Houston. Prior to drinking here, I've only been to places that literally make your milk tea drinks from powder. So coming here was a game changer.\n\nMy favorite drink is the green milk tea with 30% sugar. Just the right amount of sweetness and you can actually taste the tea. \n\nThe drinks can be a bit pricy, but I guess that's the norm around here. The only other downside is that sometimes the line is out the door, this place is crazy packed on weekends.","326":"Came here for tapioca on a Sunday afternoon and my oh my were they busy!!! Out the door busy literally! Staff are nice but getting the order and drinks took awhile! They did the bartista thing which I feel takes way to much time although it is great to watch! I got the okinwa milk tea! Tastes like a regular milk tea but thicker because of the roasted brown sugar..","327":"My friend and I stopped by here to feed our boba craving. I ordered a fresh milk oolong tea less sweet with boba while my friend ordered a boba milk tea. You can definitely taste the difference between the two but you could taste more of the tea flavor in my drink. I frequent Sharetea back in Cali and this location did not disappoint. Definitely a chill spot to hangout or you can just grab a drink to-go if you have other places to be. The only problem is finding parking in this lot, which is ALWAYS busy because there are so many places in this plaza!","328":"Great customer service (: \nRecommended drink: okinawa milk tea, oolong milk tea, green milk tea, regular black tea milk tea! \n...and Matcha!\nCrema is very interesting and yummy but it can be an acquired taste for some people. This is the only place in Houston with pearls\/boba\/tapioca cooked to perfection. It's soft, chewy, and sweet! Also no minimum for credit cards! They have stamp cards!\n\nAtmosphere: very bright and clean, I feel like I'm in Taiwan. Great hang out place for young people.","329":"They have this in HK, so I was excited to see this here in Houston. I'm hoping to see this in Dallas. I had this in SF also. A specialty drink that they have are the drinks with crema. I got the coffee crema. What they didn't do this time was to give me a tool to cut into the top. Because see you can't enjoy the crema that's on top by drinking through a straw. You need to just poke a hole at the top and drink it from the top. That way it'll allow you to drink both your drink and the cream together which is heavenly !!","330":"I ordered a matcha with fresh milk with no toppings that turned out okay but I also ordered a strawberry black tea creama. When i picked up my order, there was no creama on my strawberry black tea. When I asked about it they said I didnt want any toppings when the receipt obviously said strawberry black tea creama. they didn't offer to remake my drink or anything. I used to love this location but the one in sugar land is much better.","331":"Drinks are AWESOME! Staff name Aaron is AWESOME! He helped my friends and I on choosing drinks. He recommended the Hokkaido Milk Tea and I got to say that this drink is GREAT!\nI would recommend my friends and families to this place!","332":"Okay. Yes. This is my go-to place for boba. Even though sometimes the wait can be long, and even though they messed up my whole order once... And even though they don't let you order over the phone.... I still love this place. Firstly, they're the only boba place in Houston that I know of that serves brown sugar milk tea (Okinawa milk tea). It's so good. I first tried brown sugar milk tea in LA and fell in love and was obviously excited to find a place in Houston that serves the same. I also like their QQ family milk tea. Not sure where the name comes from but it comes with I think 5 different toppings inside of it! It's like eating a snack or dessert for me lol. Studying here can be good as well, they have some outlets but the chairs are a little uncomfortable. They also have a stamp card and there is no cash minimum for using your card so that's a plus!","333":"This is the best boba place in Houston. I've had a lot of boba in my life and the way I compare different places is by trying the classic milk tea. I can say with confidence that Sharetea has the best classic milk tea. It's creamy and has just the right amount of tea to milk proportion. Additionally, the tapioca is on point. It's fresh warm and made to be the right texture. It has a subtle flavor that won't overwhelm the drink. Additionally their fruit drinks and creamers are also good. I would advise not to get drinks at 100% sugar. I think that 30% is probably good enough, sometimes when the sugar amount is too high, the authentic flavor of the drink disappears.","334":"Small selection but good options. Probably among the best milk tea I've had. I would get 50% sweetness because their teas do tend on the sweeter side. Their Matcha Berry Boba with Strawberry Boba (hardly tastes like strawberry and was harder than regular honey boba) is good.","335":"Their recipes are very different from other boba places. Each of their tea drinks has a very strong aroma & significant taste to distinguish themselves from other ordinary places. Probably that's why the line seems to never stop especially during weekend nights. I always go with Oolong Milk Tea or Oolong Tea. Their Oolong tea drinks are the BEST! Nowhere else has that same quality level. Mango green tea is great as well. ;)","336":"My favorite drinks are the the the hokkaido milk tea, okinawa milk tea, and taro smoothie with egg pudding. The hokkaido milk tea is caramel toffee flavored, but somehow the combination tastes like coconut milk to me, which is pleasant but unexpected. Okinawa milk tea is my favorite, it is roasted brown sugar flavored and tastes just a little nuttier than normal milk tea. The taro smoothie is the bomb dot com, especially with egg pudding and even better with boba added too! I usually don't like egg pudding, but it is excellent here. Also tried out the matcha green tea with red bean, which is okay, nothing to write home about. The layer of red beans at the bottom of the cup was an interesting topping and a welcome surprise, starchy and sweet. \n\nThe creama drinks are really weird. It comes with a little plastic lid cutter that you use to cut slits in the top to sip the creama. I'm not fond at all of the salty, lukewarm cream layer on top, it's just unpleasant. So many euphemisms to be made, but I will resist. However, my drink was salvaged by mixing it all together and just drinking through the straw, but I still can't say that I fully enjoyed it. I typically like salt on my desserts, but I just couldn't like the cremas.\n\nThe boba in my drinks have been warm each time I've gone here, which is reassuring to know the boba is fresh. But since they are getting so many customers and have to cook boba constantly, it looks like all the heat from the cooked boba melts all the ice too quickly and makes the drink taste like milk water in 15 minutes. SO, I highly suggest getting less ice, which is free of charge anyways! The boba here is delicious, always perfectly cooked through, chewy and sweet. They are also super generous with the boba, so don't be afraid to run out of boba when you hit the bottom of your cup, because you'll definitely have some leftover.\n\nNow one of my favorite teahouses! I'm waiting til my next visit to try the QQ Happy Family Tea and the high mountain milk tea :D","337":"Sharetea has really great milk tea! I came here to get some work done between appointments. They have a good amount of tables and helpful staff. I usually get Oolong Milk Tea here with tapioca. You can pick the sweetness and how much ice you want, I get the normal amount of both.\n\nThe wifi here is usually good too. Their network is \"Sharetea\" and once you connect they'll have a password for you to enter. Right now it's \"sharehappiness\". I put it in and it never connected to the Internet for me so I ended up having to hot spot off my phone, but it has worked for me in the past.","338":"I love boba and I'm always looking for new places to try. This is my third visit and I'd have to say the customer service is excellent and I can easily rate their service 5 stars. \n\nI had their classic milk tea and their black tea was too light for my preference. They really tried hard to satisfy my expectations and even remade it for me a few times. Hey for $4-$5 bucks a drink, you would want it to taste good, right? On the other hand, their tapioca was prepared perfectly. It was soft and chewy with a hint of sweetness. \n\nLast time I had the mango tea and thought it was pretty refreshing. It's different from most boba spots as this mango tea had bits of mango and was lightly sweetened. If I'm ever craving a mango tea with boba, I would come here.","339":"I would say this is Kung Fu Tea's competition. I have yet to try everything on the menu but I've found that their Milk Green Tea tastes better to me than the one at KFT. I've also tried the Okinawa Milk Tea but the flavor tasted too burnt to me. The line here can get long at times. \n\nThey have something here called Crema drinks that I want to try next time I come. Essentially it's tea at the bottom and a cream thing that floats at the top of the drink and as you drink it, it mixes together. \n\nYou can customize the drink sweetness\/ice levels here. They also have baby tapioca! (my favorite)","340":"Came here first time tonite. Got a macha green tea w\/ red bean. It was not as good as all the hype. Maybe I ordered the wrong one.\n\nBut that was not so much why I didn't like this place. \nThe environment was definitely for young crowd.\nThe deco was very plain. Too plain.  \nThe staff was not as friendly as should be.  We were there at closing time and a young staff member blasted the music to a deafening volume to kick us out. Everyone was running out with their drinks in hands.  It was ridiculously rude. \nSomeone need to teach the staff that it is unacceptable to behave that way.\nI will not come back again. There are other tea next door.","341":"Obsessed with the drinks here. The taro smoothie is sooooo good, but my go to drink is the Almond Milk Tea (Beauty drink). And I can adjust sweetness level which is a plus as I don't like my drinks super sweet. \n\nSo far, everything we have tried has been delicious.","342":"A lot of people complain about how slow service is, but they should know everyone here is new. I'm alright with that. Practice makes perfect. \n\nI came here during their soft opening, came here during their grand opening, and still coming here lol. This is one of the newer tapioca location in Bellaire. I've been waiting for this place to open since I first saw its sign outside. Finally. FINALLY. I've tried a bunch of their milk tea but I love the ice cream black tea the most. They use black tea with a scoop or two of ice cream. It's the perfect combination being not too sweet. \n\nIf you're more into the fruity teas, the passion fruit tea is good as well! Probably gonna stop by here tonight just thinking about it.","343":"I was a little apprehensive about trying Sharetea, since many reviews indicate disorganization and longer wait times. I think they have worked out all their kinks - my husband and I were in and out in about 10 minutes with our drinks on our first visit.\n\nFirst thing's first - Sharetea is located in Dung Huang Plaza, in the strip that is directly facing Bellaire. It's right next door to Tea Bar and Organics. The interior looks very similar to Kung Fu Tea, with more red accents. If you frequent Kung Fu Tea, you'll instantly see the resemblance in their layout, tables, chairs, and even the college-aged crowd.\n\nI will compare this to Kung Fu Tea, as it has been my go-to place for milk tea the past couple of years. Sharetea allows for customization like KFT does, so you can pick your desired amount of sugar and ice with your drink. Went with my usual here - milk tea with boba at 30% sugar. The tea used isn't the most complex or aromatic, but the milk to tea ratio was on point, and my drink had a very pleasant creaminess to it. The boba was perfectly chewy, but slightly more bland in taste compared to Kung Fu Tea. My husband tried the Okinawa Milk Tea, which had nice hints of caramel, I would recommend this if you want to try something more unique.\n\nOverall, I'd say this place is pretty comparable to Kung Fu Tea. It's got a few extra things going for it though. There is no credit card minimum, the staff here is friendlier, their drinks are a little cheaper, and they have a stamp card (buy ten, get one free).","344":"I rarely come to chinatown but when I do seems to have new teahouses every single time a bit crazy and saturated. Sharetea \"shares\" the plaza with 4 or more other teahouses. Also this is a Taiwanese establishment so for sure I had to support it. But my 3 Star is not hating this place!!!\n\nCame here with my sister we ordered Okinawa milk tea w\/ tapioca and oolong tea. First I would like to say how awesome tasting Okinawa milk tea is, definitely gives it a different taste instead of sugar water to sweeten its sweetened with roasted brown sugar!! How good does that sound Roasted Brown Sugar?!!?! well It is as good as it sounds. You get to choose your sweetness levels except for this drink. But I must say it wasn't too sweet it was just perfect. Tapioca was perfectly cooked and sweetened. Sisters Oolong tea was ehhh I'm not a fan, So I won't speak about it. \n\nThey have this Crema drinks section, a bit interesting a normal tea drink with this frothy milk\/whip concoction. Seems to be a popular thing so will give it a go. So my decision to give it a 3 star instead of a 5 star is the wait!! I came on a monday and to receive 2 drinks took over 25mins!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Not really sure what this waits all about but this for sure will not deter me from this place.","345":"Just because it's a popular spot, it does not give you the right to give terrible service. We walked in 20 minutes before closing and the two employees making the tea started rolling their eyes at me. I asked him are you guys closed, he rudely replied no. So if you're not closed make my drink without the attitude. I was so mad, I made my group of 7 people leave. He was looking away cause he knew I was about to cause a scene. There's literally 8 tapioca stores around you, with this kind of attitude you can go from current to out of business in a blink of an eye. Retrain your employees!","346":"Very nice staff and enjoyable environment. It's a good place to hangout and maybe even do your homework while enjoying a good cup of boba tea! The classic milk tea is really a classic and their boba is nice and chewy! I would definitely come back for more :)","347":"Good place to be for taiwanese Boba tea. It's a go to for sure among the competition for your thirst. I would say they have among some of the most flavor or mix selection you can choose from.","348":"Their mango green tea is SUPER good!! It has shredded mango in it! This was my first time there and now I crave it!! \n\nThe wait is a little long even though there are 3 people working there for 5 guests, but the product was great!","349":"Reasons why I keep going to this particular boba shop:\n1) They accept CARD payment with no minimum fee.   You know if you go to Chinatown, most places only accept cash or they charge you a minimum fee. \nCredit\/debit Card users, rejoice and save yourself the headache of withdrawing money from an atm.\n \n2) Great customer service. Look, usually when I go to Chinatown, I know I'm going to expect rude service and I usually ignore it. But at sharetea, not only do they know how to provide great services to customers, they speak English (I'm azn so I ain't racist), they are not yelling at you, or make you feel bad. An attitude free zone, how refreshing to walk in a boba shop and not get yelled at by a sassy employee.\n\n3) The drinks are yummy. Way too sugary for my taste, but you have the option to lessen the sugar in the drinks. \n\nOverall:\nOpen-mindedness + Great customer service + yummy drinks = returning and loyal customer","350":"I had passion fruit Yakult tea and and it was sooo good! I could taste the freshness and just the perfect balance of sweetness and fruity sourness! I'm from Taiwan and I'd say they do have some really authentic stuff here. Boba was good as well - chewy, brown sugar coated, and not too sticky. Will  definitely refer friends here and come back soon!","351":"Wintermelon Green Tea - must NOT get, it has a very strange after taste\n\nMango Green Tea Creama- one of my favorite drinks to get here","352":"Sharetea seems to have won the battle of boba shops in Dun Huang, with lines going nearly out the door every weekend. Other shops might be just as popular (like Class 502), but people aren't going to them for the bubble tea. And it's easy to see why. Sharetea has a clean, modern interior, fair prices, fantastic customization, and a creative, Taiwanese style menu that's unique among shops here. As a successful international chain, their operation is very refined and they seem to add new items to the menu every now and then.  \n\nTheir milk teas are decent. The tea is strong but they dilute it too much by adding in a ton of premixed non-dairy creamer (from their giant milk dispenser machine thingy). It ends up being around half tea-half creamer which isn't the worst, but also not the greatest. Honeybee and Twinkle make better milk teas to me. But there are still way more pros than cons here, like the unique drinks and toppings like Ginger Milk Tea (actually really good), Okinawa Milk Tea (roasted brown sugar), and aiyu jelly (must be the only shop here that has this delicious Taiwanese specialty). They always ask for your sugar level - 80% or less recommended - and ice level - no ripping off here. \n\nBut by far the top reason to come here is that they make the best, most consistent tapioca you'll find ANYWHERE. It's always fresh (thanks to its popularity), perfectly cooked, and well sweetened. They know that cold liquid ruins the chewyness\/QQ of tapioca and chill the drink separately from the tapioca, combining the two only at the end without mixing. The finished product has cold drink on top and a layer of warm, chewy tapioca at the bottom that stays fresh until you're ready to mix it up. Perfect!\n\nItems to avoid: Fresh taro milk tea and the Creamas, which are way too salty and rich. If you want a good sea salt cream milk tea, Phi Coffee & Tea in HK4 mall makes a much more balanced version.","353":"Really yummy drinks!! Heard lots of good things about Sharetea from friends and family and finally had a chance to try it out last night. I got the Okinawa pearl milk tea. Very bold and aromatic tea flavor which had so much depth added from the roasted brown sugar. It's like comparing choice beef (average milk tea) versus prime dry aged beef (Sharetea). The Okinawa milk tea just had a depth of tea flavor that I haven't had in Houston. Husband had the matcha green tea crema and he equally loved his drink. It is extremely creamy and even has a slight salted caramely taste to it.\n\nLine was long, and they ran out of regular boba and pudding, but luckily we were some of the last folks to snatch the mini boba which was deliciously chewy and plentiful (10pm on a Sunday night). Drinks came out within a few minutes after ordering. \n\nLove that their prices are slightly less than KF Tea and they have a punch card for loyalty rewards. \n\nReally perfect ending to a nice casual date night with the husband. We only have one issue... we have had mad cravings all day for Sharetea. The struggle is real!!","354":"I'm usually not a fan of boba, only the drinks however, I was very impressed by Sharetea's boba! I've only been to this location twice now (more times in San Diego) and my favorite is the Hokkaido milk tea with mini pearls. I tried the classic milk tea, brown sugar milk tea, and passionfruit\/peach tea. All were pretty good but I will stick to the Hokkaido :) The drinks are a bit pricey however I believe it's worth it compared to other boba shops that I tried in Houston. \n\nAlthough I am giving Sharetea 5 stars, I want to point out that the wait time and line gets long. There is only one register so far and looks like two machines to seal the drinks. I'm sure within a year or so, this shop will expand a bit and might have more registers :)","355":"Been here a couple of times and still can't figure out what makes this place better than others. The drinks seem a bit watered down but perhaps that's what others mean when they say Sharetea has more of a tea flavor than milk? Whatever it is, I'm not really a fan.","356":"Their milk tea tastes closer to the authentic Taiwanese milk teas ... as in, the actual milk tea you drink when you are in Taiwan.  WIN!  It's more creamy than your average milk tea.  Service is a little bit slow, and the line can get quite long, but the tea is good.  Check it out if you haven't already.","357":"Usually with new boba places I like stick to Milk Black Tea and Milk Green Tea to start it off. Sharetea didn't impress me like the way Kung Fu did. I'm grateful for the credit minimum and their stamp card but honestly speaking their drinks tasted watered down, barely tasted any creamer or even the tea it's self. I rather stick to Kung Fu tea, the price didn't isn't so bad probably .50 cent to a $1.00 more. I'll probably be back to try the cremas they have there one day but for now I rather stick to other boba places.","358":"Every time I come to Houston, Chinatown has a new boba place to go to.  Last time it was Kung Fu Tea, and now it's this place, so I wanted to see what the hype was all about. \n\nImmediate plus: they take credit card w\/o some minimum criteria like many places in Chinatown. \n\nInterior: clean, fresh, open, but packed. \n\nI went on a late Sunday night thinking I would avoid crowds, but NO - basically ALL of Chinatown decided to go to share tea that night.  I waited 30 minutes for a hot milk tea, 80% sweetened, and no boba.  What would typically take 2 minutes to make, took 30 because of the ridiculous line.  Granted, they only had two people making drinks, but after watching the workers take their sweet time making drinks, I was hardly impressed.  #salty\n\nHowever, I'll give it to them.  The milk tea was pretty good.  Wasn't worth waiting 30 minutes.. Maybe just 15 minutes.  And FYI, the milk tea tastes better hot than cold here.  Perfect for \"cold Houston\" weather.  \n\nI do plan to come back to try other drinks, but definitely won't come if I'm pressed on time. (Personally, I still prefer KFT...)","359":"So I've tried two drinks here, the milky taro and the O Milk tea (the one w\/brown sugar i think) but really the most important thing was they offer baby tapioca. The wait is a while, guess they were making fresh boba, but I'm not sure because they ran out of regular boba.\n\nDrinks weren't too sweet, love that it was real taro in the milky taro, so you got alot of texture. The milk tea however was real good, will have to come back for more.","360":"Good milk tea. The times I've gone there were no lines. There is no card limit and they accept all credit cards. I've tried the Okinawa and the Classic Milk Tea. Both were good. The free Wi-Fi here is fast. It is a hit or miss when studying here; the place can get really noisy with customers and even he employees taking loudly.","361":"Sharetea opened pretty recently, and I finally got to try it yesterday. It is a decent boba place, though not amazing. Their tea is tasty, but the boba itself is not my fave. In terms of ambience, it is well lit and cheery and has some small wooden tables. However, the shop is small, so it's best to get your drinks to-go. The service is very nice, so no complaints. \n\nI got a honey milk tea with boba, and it was way too sweet for me since I forgot to ask for reduced sugar. The flavor itself was nice though, like traditional milk tea with a honey aftertaste. The bobas are a bit harder than I usually like them, but that may be a personal preference. My friend got a warm okinawa milk tea, and she said it was good. It's cool that they have a special cup for the warm drinks. \n\nI'd come again and try their other drinks. Their creamas look unique and yummy!","362":"The boba competition in Dun Huang Plaza is ridiculous. Sharetea, with its Taiwanese roots and solid menu, is a strong contender, though. Their classic black tea is quite good. The staff is also willing to explain the menu and detail what is and isn't customizable (e.g. they cannot adjust the creamer levels in the milk teas or the sugar levels in some of the powder-based drinks). They are extremely generous with the boba (no need to ration the pearls, the tea will definitely run out first), and they do not charge for no ice. Even better, they do not have a credit card minimum.\n\nThis is a good study place, particularly on the quieter weekdays. The space is very open, well-lit, and clean with a good amount of seating and adequate number of outlets.","363":"This place will be the reason I go broke. \n\nOut of all the places I've gone for tapioca, this is by far the best place. The prices are reasonable, and they have great customer service. You can modify the sugar, ice, and syrup level without an extra charge. I'm not a fan of milk-based drinks, but they have a category called \"Creama\" where they add this homemade cream on top of your drink. I personally never tried it, but supposedly it's pretty good. I go for their Wintermelon Tea. Sharetea has the best Wintermelon flavor out of all the tapioca places I've been to in Houston - and trust me, I've been to a lot. \n\nThey have free wi-fi and a decent amount of tables so it's great place to come and study. On the weekends it's buku packed, so be prepared to wait for ~15 minutes or more. I personally think it's worth it, even though I always finish my drink in less than five minutes...","364":"Tip: order online\/pay online and your order will be ready for pickup right when you arrive!  \n\nThe boba is a good chewy texture and mildly sweet. I like the small pieces of mashed fruit in their peach drinks. Winter melon with fresh milk is good too. The service is fast, organized, and friendly.\n\nCons: I was surprised that on an early Saturday morning, they were already out of several jellies and they didn't seal the five to-go drinks that I ordered, but gave plastic snap on lids instead. The floor had unappealing dirt marks but I guess that's just a side effect of white floors that are hard to maintain!","365":"I don't see what the hype is about here. Drinks were average. I tried their Hokkaido milk tea and their Taro milk tea. Service was fast and friendly. This place gets pretty pack.","366":"One of my favorite places to stop by in Bellaire to get a drink. I normally order the coffee milk tea with code jelly, a little lighter on the sugar. Drinks always perfect, but the down side is how there's always a line out the door. Boo.","367":"Expensive and not very good. The wait for my two drinks took 20 minutes. There was one person making drinks and it took them forever. 4.50 for one drink plus a charge if you don't have cash! Tsk tsk tsk","368":"4 is for their oolong high mountain fresh milk tea. Oolong is great also. The tea is nice and strong. I like teahouses that has a strong taste of tea. However we did not like the creama at all. It tasted heavy thick and a bit salty. It was not the type of tea for us. I like that they give you a little plastic knife to slit an opening for the creams drink. Or you can just use the tip of your straw to make an opening. \n\nWhen I first saw and heard about their creama I thought it would be like the cloudo I had in NYC, which was fantastic, but sadly it wasn't. \n\nI ended up shaking and mixing up my oolong creama drink. Though it did not help kill the salty aftertaste. My bf loves his oolong milk tea and my sister likes her  green milk tea. \n\nI would come back for their tea though since it taste great.\n\nStrong tea and no creamer\/milk powder is a definite plus!!!","369":"This review is to share my bad experience from their \"no remake of wrong drink\" customer service.\n\nI ordered a honey green milk tea with mini boba, but they made me just a honey green tea with mini boba. So I told them that's the wrong drink. A manager like guy came over and show me the order receipt was honey green tea, no milk. He said they can't remake a wrong drink, and rudely blame me for not checking the order before I paid. He repeated that accuse loudly at least 3 times but didn't really suggest a solution. I guess he tried to embarrass me in front of the crowd and force me to take the wrong drink. \n\nI then noticed there's a 25 cents price difference, so I told him I can paid for the difference. He told me I needed to paid 54 cents. I asked him why not 25 cents on the menu, he said rudely because he can't remake the wrong drink and has to charge more to make a new drink. I didn't want to argue at all so I just gave the cashier 60 cents. She looked very sorry and tried to give me back 6 cents. I told her no worry and to keep the change.\n\nThen the guy took the wrong drink aside and just simply added milk back to the green tea to make it milk green tea.  So I puzzled myself where is the can't remake a drink and has to make a new drink saying? Is that 29 cents gain really that important to trump over customer service reputation?\n\nI really didn't want to make a scene as I just want a milk tea. It may be a bad day for the guy. However I think we should not tolerate this kind of impolite and inappropriate attitude to customer. As noted in other review they also refused to remake wrong order very often, and treated different customers differently. At the end is it really that hard and costly to remake a wrong drink?","370":"I am not a fan of Sharetea's drinks. I've only been once, so I really should give it another shot, but with seven tapioca places in this plaza, I don't really feel like gambling. \n\nI ordered a regular Milk Tea with High Mountain tea. They have four different choices for teas for the milk tea you order. Black, Green, High Mountain and something else, I can't remember. I chose High Mountain because it was late at night and the lady at the counter said it was lighter than Green Tea. \n\nHigh Mountain Green Tea: It was really weird. It tasted like it was almost all tea and very little milk, but the drink was extremely frothy. My mouth was confused. It was not a satisfying drink. \n\nCreama Oolong Tea with tapioca: even more weird.. The drink gets its name from a layer of salted cream sitting on top of the tea. They give you this little plastic box cutter looking tool with instructions to cut two slits at the top to sip the cream, even though you get a straw to sip the tea+tapioca from. The salted cream was lukewarm so I almost gagged. It was gross. Like drinking warm milk that had been left out and had solidified a little already. Luckily it wasn't my drink so I wasn't stuck with it. My friend said it tasted better after she mixed all of the cream with the drink. This type of drink would probably work well as a dessert, and they do offer a cocoa version of this drink, so maybe I'll try that next time. Maybe... maybe. \n\nWintermelon and lemon juice: odd, but refreshing in its own way, I guess. Not something I would order again. \n\nI will say that they don't have a minimum for credit card charges and they don't tack on .50cents for using a credit card either. So that was a different change of pace for an establishment in Chinatown. \n\nAlso, the entire place is really bare. They need to do something with their walls because the decor is kind of boring, though the lights are really bright. \n\nMaybe they just need a little more time to perfect and tweak out the little things? Guess I'll find out in a couple of months.","371":"I have tried Sharetea in different countries in Asia and this is the worst. My favorite drink is Green Milk Tea and Creama. However, the drinks are always not well-shaked, they are all milk powder inside. Plus, customer service is getting worse, one of the male cashier was ignoring my gf when she came to order at the counter and turn his back busy talking to his friends (she was the only customer in line). The only reason I go to this place is because my gf already collect 8 stars and she want to complete her points to redeem her free drink. After that, no more coming back.","372":"I didn't want to get any milk tea because I am sick of the stuff.  I needed some brewed oolong tea to improve my digestion of a heavy Chinese meal.  The tea was hot but not super hot which I really wanted because it was colder than hell outside.  The tea tasted ok but nothing stood out since I didn't add anything to it.  The place is a young Asian kid hangout.  Not a rowdy place at all.  Just boring.  What's interesting about this place is that they serve green tea without the jasmine which is hard to find in Chinatown.  To be honest I really don't think Chinatown has any good quality tea houses.","373":"Milk tea and Okinawa are my favorite but I will try out others one day.\n\nI put it in the same tier as KFT because my experience got better the more I came as well as the tea itself. Funny because I was not a fan after receiving watery milk tea the first time I came here.\n\nNo credit card min so that might be a plus for some of yall.","374":"This is my favorite milk tea spot in Chinatown now! I always get the same drink here now after discovering it during one of my first visits. The mango milk green tea! It may sound odd, but the flavors work perfectly together and you get something fruity and milky at the same time! Ask to get it with half sugar if you don't like your drinks too sweet!","375":"When we first walked down the strip and pass many other tea place we saw a line running out the door and I asked my sister that can't be the place we going to right?  She said yes it is, and in my head I said oh great because you know me I hate to wait. Well my wife and sister waited in line as I stood outside waiting and watching more people come to stand in the line. When we finally got our drinks it had been almost 30 minutes. Was it worth the wait? Probably not. Was it good? Yes, but definitely not the best I've had but still good. If I'm in a hurry I would probably just try one of the other places out.","376":"I spend so much money at this place .. The person who took the order seem not to be happy. I order taro milktea with half scoop of lychee. I know this drink come with pearl that why I told her taro milk tea...but when the order came out it didn't have lychee but boba ...so i came back and waited....for them to finish with other drink. The person who took the order came over. And I told her I didn't ask for boba I ask for lychee. She straight up say this drink come with boba....I told her that why I said taro milktea. And she just walk away to do the drink. Not even a sorry.  She shoudnt work there if she can't handle customers.","377":"I like their drinks. It's nice that they can adjust the sweetness and you can request of you want less ice. But you can't adjust the sweetness level for all drinks. The Hokkaido and Okinawa milk teas are already pre made. The cashier will say these milk teas do not come with sugar. But I think she means it doesn't come with additional sugar. \nThe few drinks I've gotten here are pretty good. But they are kind of slow at making the drinks. Sometimes they even stop what they're doing if a customer comes up to request something. I don't mind waiting if it means they are making quality drinks, but multitask. And not every employee needs to stop what they're doing to tend to one party. I think it's weird when businesses give special attention and priority to customers of other races.","378":"I saw one of my friends checked into this place on Facebook and I immediately went onto YELP to see all the reviews and pictures. The place is still \"green\" so there were not many reviews. However, I live relatively close to Chinatown so I was determined to go there ASAP. The line was still long around 9-10PM and it took longer than it should have to make two drinks. My usual safe choices are milk tea and honey green tea...so my boyfriend and I ordered honey green tea and matcha green tea. They didn't have plain matcha green tea but they can make it without the RED BEANS for you. I really love places that offer different levels of sweetness so I don't turn diabetic! I went for 80% sweetness and the drink was still good. Their boba was great...chewy with a hint of sweetness. You will probably need your headphones with your music on blast if you want to study here at night. They have a website so I do recommend looking at it first so you can order right away when you get there. If my memory serves me right...their matcha green tea creama apparently has some sort of cheese in it!!!! I was not adventurous enough to try that but you can (and then write a review so i can read all about the experience)!!! I will come back to try more of their drinks! *thumbs up*","379":"There seems to always be a line here! To me that has to be a good thing... Their drinks are always tasty.   I've tried multiple locations across the country and have always enjoyed.","380":"Out of all of the many bubble tea places I have tried in Chinatown, Sharetea has proven to me to be the best. Sharetea has managed to successfully execute in offering a wide array of drinks and toppings, providing a nice space to sit and enjoy your drink and watch a sporting event on the TV available if need be, and providing fast, accurate and friendly service. Of the handful of different flavored drinks I have tried here, most of them were the best I've had. There are still a few other drink flavors I would like to try here. I'm glad a newly opened bubble tea spot has come to raise the bar for bubble tea in Chinatown.","381":"I'm a fan of the mango ice blended with ice cream + boba (of course)! Tastes refreshing and just right - not overly sweet. Boba is tasty as well!\n\nLine gets long but moves fast. Spacious, modern, and clean inside as well. Go check them out!","382":"No matter which ShareTea I come upon, they still keep the same level of consistency. I have had my first ShareTea 3 years ago back in my hometown in California and let me tell you, that first sip of Mango Green Tea took me back home. So thank you ShareTea, thank you for being in Houston!","383":"With all the boba cafes in the Dun Huang Center, what sets this place apart is the real fruit juice in their fruit teas. My boyfriend and I have been here multiple times trying each fruit tea. My favorite is the passion fruit & mango green tea. The first time I had it, I noticed that there were real passion fruit seeds in the drink, so you know there's real fruit in there. Most of the fruit teas are sweet enough so we don't add any sugar.\n\nLike most of the boba cafes these days you can adjust sugar and ice levels. Drinks have been consistent and service is fast. There are rush hours especially on weekends so expect a long line, but usually don't have to wait for more than 10 minutes once you order. \n\nThe boba is soft and chewy. I've tried a few of their milk teas and they were okay.  The Happy QQ is great with all the toppings but can be a little sweet because of that.  The only criticism is that I would like more tea flavor overall in all of their drinks.\n\nThey have plenty of seats and I've seen groups bring card games to play there. They currently updated their rewards system so that all you do is put in a phone number to record the number of drinks you've purchased. Prices are reasonable.","384":"Sharetea carries tea imported straight from Taiwan! Their tea has a gentle but delicious flavor and any of their teas can be combined with their home made herb jelly (loved it) or fruit or pudding etc. \n\nI especially loved that almost all of the drinks can be served hot as well as cold. It's a great find for people like me who like their drinks warm. Being able to customize my drink was wonderful!\n\nThe employees are all fluent in English and courteous. The ambience is very relaxing and there is a lot of open space. A great place to sit and study or chat over tea! Will definitely be going back for more!","385":"I only come here for the wintermelon tea with egg pudding and it is really good.\n\nI like that they give you a choice for the quantity of ice and sugar which most other places do not have. You can also get points through your phone number.","386":"The drinks are pretty good. Their teas are fresh which is nice, but perhaps I came at a bad time, it took about 15mins for my orders to be ready. Even. With a lot of staff behind the counter. The creama teas are a little disappointing, not as great as I though it would be. All in all, this is a good place to hang out.","387":"First of all, I love the service. The people who work here are really nice; they don't rush you or serve you with a side of saltiness. \nNow, the drinks. Like many places, you can customize your level of sweetness. The unique part is their tea, as you can choose from different kinds. The green and black teas that I have tried have been consistently fresh. The grapefruit green tea is made from pulpy grapefruit juice- love.\nThe only issue I have is that there is a wait for drinks to be ready, and that isn't very good for this type of to-go beverage.\nDuring the day, the place is pretty quiet. In the evening though, don't expect to get any studying or work done. \nWifi is pretty reliable, and the place is clean. Can't say the same for a lot of other places in the area, so this place is a WIN.","388":"I was excited to try out Sharetea, since it was one of my favorite boba places in San Francisco, and maybe it was unfair of me to expect the same experience in Houston. The service was wonderful, the workers extremely friendly, and it had a great and peaceful ambience that could be conducive for being productive or catching up with friends. \n\nThe drinks come in the same size, and at a reasonable price. I got the Brown Sugar Milk Tea (Okinawa) with less sugar (80%), no ice, and regular boba. The tea itself was pretty good, but the boba was sort of hard. We also went in the evening, so that might have been why, but it was disappointing. I didn't end up finishing the boba, just drinking the tea instead.","389":"Their service was very fast and the boba here was soft and not too sweet like other places. The green tea ice cream was perfectly sweet and creamy, and you could also taste the rich tea flavor. Also, it's a nice study spot as there's always students studying in the shop","390":"Every once in a while, I'll start to notice a shift in boba popularity. Originally, I felt as though the majority of my feed was just pictures of Kung Fu Tea, but now all I see is ShareTea everywhere.\n\nOf course, being the bandwagoner I am, I had to give it a try. There's a strong, distinct flavor in each type that I try and the honey boba unmistakably adds a really nice touch to each sip.\n\nMy favorite has to be the wintermelon tea with 80% sweetness. In other places, it tastes extremely artifical but I just think that the flavors incorporate really well here. Nearly 6 of my 8 stamps are just from buying this drink.\n\nIn terms of tapioca, there isn't that much one can criticize about. The atmosphere is nice, it feels extremely modern and no matter what time I go , there always seem to be a long line that is just inches from the entrance door.","391":"Probably the best milk tea I ever had. This place has definitely beat out other joints as my new go-to. I have been sleeping on Sharetea for so long and I'm so glad I finally gave it a try.","392":"Love their Mango Green Milk Tea! They even have mango pulp! The fianc\u00e9e and I love it so much that we're serving it at our wedding :)","393":"Wow!! We had the Classic Pearl Milk Black Tea and it was so good! The tea tastes high quality and the tapioca pearls are chewy and sweet. No wonder the line was long! The drinks are worth the wait though!","394":"One of the best boba places in Houston!\n\nAll the other boba places we've tried were not as good in terms of the tea and boba quality. \n\nAnd this place just knows how to make it right.\n\nI've had Sharetea in San Diego and Alhambra in California and it's of the same quality. I've had boba from all over the world and this place is up there :D.","395":"Great service and they even ask you your preference in sweetness for the drink you ordered. The amount of sugar they put in a tea drink without the cream is one tablespoon, if that gives you perspective.\n\nIt's a really open area and a great hang out place!","396":"Always packed and always a line. For good reason! The tea here ROCKS.\nI have been back countless amounts of times and they make one of the most solid boba milk teas that Houston has to offer. Another thing that gets a big thumbs up is their consistency. There have been too many times where I've ordered tea at other places and it comes out either too sweet, too bland, or just doesn't taste right. Not at Sharetea. It comes out just the way you order it. No wonder it's always so busy. Service is fast, however, and you won't be waiting long to get your drink once you order it.\n\nSeating is plentiful and the tables are quite large. You may have difficulty finding a table since this place is so popular. I would say it is more of a hang out place more than it is a study place, but I have seen a couple people study for their MCATs and STEP exams here.","397":"I had really high hopes for this place, but it just didn't meet my expectations. I have had no issues with their service! Many people have been complaining about the speed of service. There was literally a line out the door every single day when they first opened. And people were complaining about the wait........\n\nAnywho...I've only tried the milk tea, which is a little too sweet for me. I've tried it with less sugar, and I felt like it lost its \"tea\" taste. I do appreciate that you can pick your sweetness level and adjust the amount of ice in your drink. \n\nI will probably be back to try more drinks since some other items seem to be very popular.","398":"My first visit I got the BQ milk tea it's very good, then I came back to try other tea such as their classic milk tea and Hakkaido milk tea, it was alright, it's very sweet and I can taste the powdery milk in my drink. I think Kung Fu tea milk tea taste much better, I can taste the tea and it's a smooth milk tea taste.","399":"Got Happy tea drink which has 6 toppings! Pretty good! Atmosphere is casual, bright and nice! Lots of choices! Gonna come back tomorrow to try different one!","400":"this place is cool. there is a lot of competition when it comes to tea houses in this area. what i liked about this one was the customer service. the young man working the cashier was patient and helped us pick out a tea. he asked if we would like to customize the sweetness or ice levels. the drink was pretty good. not the best i had in the area but if the other places are crowded i would def come back here.","401":"Grapefruit green tea with boba. Flavor was a little too citrusy for grapefruit and almost tasted like the grapefruit zest or skin was used to flavor the drink. Asked for less sweet and it was still quite sweet for my taste. Overall flavor was ok. Will probably try the regular milk tea next time. Texture of the boba was good.","402":"The drinks are great but there's an incredibly long wait to place your order and then another wait for your drinks. Not a place to come for a quick milk tea fix. Many flavors are available but my favorite will always be the Okinawa. It has a refreshing light taste. The creama is an interesting concept but tastes awful and doesn't go well with the drinks I've tried it in. \n\nI find it odd that it's advertised for the drinker to customize sweetness level as they wish but almost all the drinks I ask for cannot have the sweetness level adjusted. \n\nLeft feeling frustrated on my most recent visit. They were out of several flavors and toppings, which they were kind enough to post on their door on hand-written, ripped signs taped to the glass. However, when I got to the front of the line, I was then told they were also unable to make any blended drinks because the machine was down.","403":"I feel like this will be one of my new spots to get tapioca. Besides horrific parking, the drinks are awesome! I got the Okinawa(I probably spelt it wrong) with tapioca. I love how the drinks really contain a tea taste and not to sweet. Not only that, the amount of tapioca they give you is shocking. I also tried the mango milk green tea. It wasn't my exact \"cup of tea\" but I know my boyfriend definitely enjoyed it. I'll update my review once I try more of their drinks.","404":"FAVORITE BOBA PLACE. HANDS. DOWN.\n\nThere are many things that make boba great. \n1.) the level of sweetness\n2.) the taste of the tea\n3.) the taste of the boba (is it fresh, new, too chewy, too hard)\n4.) the freshness of the milk\n5.) the selection of drinks and teas\n\nShareTea has ALL these things! You can choose your level of sweetness and ice. Both which they make pretty accurate if you order 0% your drink will not be sweet, unless the type of sinkers you add make the drink sweeter, for example: adding pudding or aloe increases sweetness. The tea they make fresh, actually all the drinks they make fresh. You can tell with certain drinks like almond milk tea, they grind the almonds to make their own almond milk in house, and another drink the taro milk tea because there are real taro chunks! These are the kind of ingredients that you want and need in a drink because everything is FRESH! \nThen you can choose from regular milk tea or fresh milk tea, and you can tell there id a difference in the fresh milk because it is as the name describes-- FRESH! \n\nThe only down side is sometimes in the Bellaire area the parking is kinda hard to come by. \nAlso, because share tea is so great the line is always out the door, but that is ok because the staff moves very quickly to get orders, and always double checking to ensure that the order is accurate!","405":"Started with really long lines when it first opened, although now it has died down a bit. Although some say overrated (especially cause of the long lines), but overall, I like their tea primarily cause of the balanced sugar to milk to tea ratio, and it doesn't taste too watered down. Tea flavor still comes through. You can customize the sweetness level if you want. \n\nOther than that, spacious seating (or waiting) and some staff that doesn't really know what they're doing or explaining, but hey, still worth it for their tea.","406":"Amazing! Falling in love by my first time here.  \nMy favorite drink is black creama tea. Highly recommend!","407":"The cashier was super friendly explaining their menu during my very first visit.\n\nSometimes the lines can be long but surprisingly they can get your order out rather quickly! \n\nI've gotten the matcha creama, grapefruit green tea, Hokkaido milk tea, and Okinawa and they all haven't disappointed me yet. I like the different ice and sweet options. Also, you can taste how fresh their tea is! The tapioca here is also super chewy and they're pretty consistent with it too.\n\nComparing it to KFT, I have my preferred drinks from both places. It's really hard to say which is better. Maybe sharetea though since they don't have a credit card min.","408":"Overall, this place is good. They drink options are not as extensive as a place like teahouse but what they lack in diversity they make up for in quality.\n\nThey offer a few items unique to their shop, like this creama that I don't think I understand so well...I ordered it and they handed me a tiny little knife that they didn't explain what was for. Dug around through the Yelp photos that it was for tasting the creama at simultaneously rather than waiting until the end. Alternatively, one could just mix it in but it might change the drink experience.\n\nI also like that the sweetness and ice levels can be adjusted (for most drinks), a huge plus for me. Frequent buyer\/stamp cards are also available.\n\nI've visited here several times already, and have tried the taro, Okinawa milk tea, and the coffee ice cream blend. Have yet to be disappointed!","409":"One of the best teahouse in Houston. Their speciality - Okinawa and Hokkaido are worth trying!  And actually, our family has a mild addiction to both tea flavors.  I've tried a few different teas and all of it is very consistent - fragrant tasty tea where you can taste the tea flavor.\n\nAtmosphere:  young teenager hang out that could have been lifted straight out of Taiwan.   Cashier is super friendly that are really excited about her tea.","410":"Tastes cleaner than other boba places I've visited.\nThe line has gotten better since it first opened, but it's still pretty busy on the weekends. Guaranteed instant access when you visit on weekday evenings. \n\nI would recommend:\n\nCoffee Milk Tea (regular sweet) with regular sized tapioca\nTheir classic Milk Tea (less sweet) with regular sized tapioca\nMango Green Tea with no tapioca","411":"This tapioca place is one of the tapioca place I have been to. Since the quality of the milk tea was unique and flavorful. The tapioca was chewy in a good way; this did not deter the overall quality of the tapioca drinks.","412":"I ordered a milk tea with pudding. The pudding taste supper weird which made me have to ask them to take it out. They told me that I'm the one who asked them to put the pudding. I was like, yes, but it's nasty. Please take it out!! Thankfully, they did. And what left is 1\/3 milk tea in the cup, with ice...","413":"This is my all-time favorite tea place in Chinatown! Although the drinks can be a bit expensive, the service is fast, there's free wifi, and the tea is not too sweet\/overloaded. My favorite is Mango Green Milk Tea. In addition, the area inside is clean and a great place to study \/ hang out.","414":"Tried Okinawa milk tea (with roasted brown sugar). It was different, but I'm not a fan of it (personal preference). \n\nThe regular milk tea was good.\n\nCan't remember the last tea we ordered (something with milk), but it wasn't good. All you can taste was milk. We didn't finish it.","415":"THIS PLACE DOESN'T HAVE A CARD MINIMUM!!\nI am so for that. I'm a broke college kid, so I hardly hold cash on me lol.\nI ordered the wintermelon tea with lemon juice and it was different, but really good!\nThere tap is is just as good as Kung fu's which is probably one of the popular tapioca places. \nIn my opinion ShareTea is up there and if you're like me and don't carry cash go here. It's just as good. \n\nThe inside of it is very spacious and clean from when I went. It's a good place to study if it isn't too busy. I would go here again.","416":"I love this place. My friend took me there and it was the first time I tried bubble tea, and now I'm addicted! It's solo perfect. Since then, I've had bubble tea in other places, but their tapioca is always on point and the place is super cute. \nMy favorite drink is the honey milk tea with tapioca and with less ice. Perfect!","417":"The taro cereal slush earned them an extra star this time. I tried the Okinawa pearl milk tea also but I didn't like it. Not getting that again but will be back for the taro cereal slush.","418":"Been here a bunch of times and is probably my favorite bubble tea spot in Chinatown. They have a ton of options and add-ins for different types of tea. The restaurant itself is pretty large with lots of seating space. It can get very busy in the evenings and the service can be pretty slow which doesn't help move things along well.","419":"I've tried all the Boba spots in this side of Chinatown and I must say, Sharetea has the best flavored tea out of all which I think is essential in determining what makes a good Boba tea. \n\nIn terms of flavor, their tea seems to be the most well-balanced (tea + milk) without it being to strong or too milky. Their boba isn't the best but their tea is to die for. I usually get the Oolong Milk tea, coffee-milk tea and the whole lemon honey green tea (not on the menu but its amazzzing)!\n\nOne thing that makes me come back to an establishment is the customer service. Unlike most Boba places *Cough-cough Kung fu tea cough cough* , Sharetea has very friendly service with staff that always make sure they get your drink right! I usually order for multiple people, so it may have more room for error, NOPE! They rarely screw up my order but when they do, I don't even need to say anything, the cashier usually looks over to make sure my large order is done right. \n\nThe best place to get milk tea with friendly service! Their quality of tea is definitely noticeable as well! No wonder they have such a famous reputation around the world!\n\nComing again this weekend.. Like always. (:","420":"The location is easy to spot from the street and looks very clean. The parking is marked for 2 hours, but who take longer than that to drink a tea?\n\nThe line was a bit long but went by really fast and my tea was soo good. I think I will come back when I get a chance.","421":"I can only give Sharetea 4 stars because of their slow service, but their bubble teas are definitely the best in the area. Their tapioca is top of the line and their variety of teas are exciting enough for me to branch out of my typical milk tea drink.","422":"Nice, simple interior. Very clean looking and the employees had cool shirts. I wouldn't mind buying one for myself. It wasn't overly crowded. The cashier was very polite and explained what the drinks are. We settled for classic milk tea- high mountain 80% sweet and hokkaido pearl milk tea which was a caramel toffee flavor. We waited 15 mins for the drinks but it was well worth it. The tea was sweet to my taste. I didn't taste any tea flavor, more so like sweetened milk and the hokkaido one had a unique taste and the flavor mellowed out making it even better. They were both very good and we will definitely visit again to try other drinks.","423":"When I first came here, I played it safe and ordered a classic milk tea with boba. It was amazing--the boba and the drink itself were both amazing, and their customizable options in regards to ice level and sweetness made the drink more personal. \nIn addition, the store has a very nice ambiance.  Plan on stopping there whenever I am in Chinatown.","424":"Another great boba spot in Houston! I love their cute packaging of their drinks and their interior! Their drinks are also very good! I always judge a place by their basic milk tea boba and I can say that this place deserves a 5 star rating! I can't wait to try this place when I go visit Taiwan!","425":"Wifi\nNo credit card limit\nSweet drinks with strong flavors (but can request less sweet)\nLine\/wait on weekends\nStamp card\n\nOverall I'm very pleased with my experience here so far! Would recommend to others.","426":"I love their boba. I love the cute little tapioca balls. They have really good milk tea and I recently tried the taro milk tea and it was good! It's cool how they are #1 in Taipei and it is here in Houston! Probably one of the best boba places around. The environment is friendly and it's a really good place to hang out with friends! I also noticed that the mango smoothie is popular! If you like smoothies better that's what I recommend!","427":"I would rate Kungfu tea in this same Dun Huang plaza a 4 stars. Now this one gets a 3 solely because of the service. They take way too long to make an order of 2 drinks, okinawa and hokkaido pearl milk tea. The roasted brown sugar one is good, definitely worth trying but the caramel toffee, i didn't taste the caramel nor the toffee but instead soy milk entirely in my cup... It kinda doesn't make sense to me that caramel toffee = soy milk in taste. And it wasn't sweet enough to me, maybe ordering extra sweet next time would do.  Pro: they give a lot of boba and these little things are so good, soft and chewy and a bit sweeter than other places, some have really bland boba. One little cons: they only have 1 size for all the drinks, large. So if its your first visit, go with someone so you can try out different drinks from your friends too because it's the first time, you dont know how the drinks are like so go for the ones you're most familiar with ( from the name and brief description) then dive for the special ones, so that your first impression isnt like... Yuck, ive had better milk tea elsewhere. Will come back to try more drinks though. :)\n\nUpdate on 2\/7: the classic milktea is good, and service this time is also great. There was a line and i was behind 5 or 6 other ppl. But i got out with my drinks within 15 mins. Keep up the good service, sharetea!","428":"Love their crema coffee and the fact they actually fill your tea up to too when you ask for no ice, hard to find in some boba places. Service is courteous and I always get my drinks 1\/2 sweet since their drinks can be too sweet for my taste buds.","429":"Got 2 orders of green milk tea, one hot and one cold. There was nobody there when I got there but it still took them a long time to finish my order. The drink was pretty awful, the milk tea had a really weird taste to it. I ended up throwing one of them away because I didn't want to give my dad a nasty drink and I barely finished the other one. So in all it was a huge waste of money.","430":"Perfect Taiwanese style tapioca drinks. Try the Creama drinks! Perfect tapioca pearls!","431":"Usually a long line at peak times (fri-sat nights)\n\nTried their regular milk tea again without ice and it was a lot better. I think sharetea is a better value than kung fu (cheaper & bigger cups), but kung fu tea is still my fav. The pearls really hit the spot for me and its pretty sweet, so will try 1\/2 sweet next time.\n\nTried taro milk tea. Wasn't bad, but tasted more like coffee than taro. Probably wouldn't order again.\n\nRed bean matcha milk tea was a-ok. I wouldn't call it my new flame, but if I felt like having something different, its a possibility.\n\nI'm bumping this place up to 4 stars because the people here aren't sassy and I have a really big team and we need some really big rings\/things\/cups of milk tea.","432":"Sharetea rocks and it's amazing!! I really love the homage Taro milk which is spot on delicious!! I could drink it every day. The milk and Taro bits are what make it amazing! You definitely must try with egg pudding!!","433":"never disappoints! boba is always chewy and soft and there are always new drinks to try! black sesame tea was very good but it was only there for a short period of time :( grapefruit green tea however heals my soul always","434":"Really good bubble tea. The bubbles are not too soft as another place and u also get to choose the sugar level which is I love the most about this place. I choose mine 50% and it's just perfect not too sweet.","435":"There are literally 20+ boba shops in china town and they're all right next to each other. I can count 5 from the top of my head in the same plaza. Share tea is a chain, they're originally from Taiwan and have shops around the world. I think their milk tea is superior than others, just a smooth milky taste thats not too strong. I normally order their mango and passion fruit tea or stick with the classic milk tea with 50% less sweetness. I personally think the 100% is too sweet.  You can customize and get different jellys, adjust sweetness and ice. This place can get pretty busy, especially on the weekends. Parking also sucks during the busy hours.","436":"Very limited options\/flavors. The tea tastes good. But the service isn't just bad, it's stupid. They got our order wrong and forgot to put tapioca in our drinks. My friend went up to let them know. They argued with him for about 5 minutes while the line backed up. Then finally he was like, \"Do I need to pay you to get the order right?\" And they made him pay 50\u00a2!! LOL!!! Utterly absurd. We used to go to this place a lot but after that we won't be back. There are way too many great tapioca tea places in Houston to tolerate that nonsense. They lost a lot of customers from a large group because they refused to accept a customer's request. I hope the 50\u00a2 was worth it!","437":"It's a nice place inside to hangout\/study, but I would definitely go somewhere else to get tapioca. Personally I think it is overprice and the drinks aren't all that great. Would I return? Only if my friends wanted to go there.","438":"Got sick and diarrhea after trying their classic milk tea with baby pearl. It doesn't even taste like milk tea but just herbal tea plus water and boba","439":"This place is amazing! It tastes just as good as the other stores in Taiwan and Cali. Their store really values quality. The interior design is very modern and spacious. Did i mention it was pretty cheap too?! And very nice employees. It has now become my weekly Sunday afternoon spot.","440":"The best tea house in Htown... HANDS DOWN! Get the Okinawa Pearl Milk Tea, Black Milk Tea or Mango Green Tea Creama. Super delish and tasty. \n\nI would say there is usually a bit of a wait during peak hours, however, if you were to go to any popular boba shop anywhere in California... You'd be waiting as well. It's definitely worth it tho.","441":"My best place for milk tea with tapioca topping, Ian addicted to this place. My boyfriend always get the passion fruit green tea, so gooood~ There is always a line to wait and they also give you stamp card (1 free drink for every 10 drinks)","442":"Love tapioca. Love Chinatown. Love Sharetea. I don't think anyone can ever say that the pricing here is high. It's really not. Pretty standard or even low, I would say. Every position on the menu is nice, so whatever you order, you'll never go wrong with your choice. My fav is their special creama drink! You definitely should try this or watermelon one!","443":"First day of their soft opening on sat, it was full house when we arrived at 9! We waited about 10 mins in line and another 20 mins for drinks. The girl who took our order was very friendly and let us know the wait was about 20 mins. They were out of regular size tapioca!! Since the drink was decent, give me an excuse to go back to try their milk tea with tapioca! Haha! Milk tea without tapioca just missing something!  Even tho i think its a bit too milky wish they can be more tea flavor~ The regular sweet is way too sweet to me, so i asked for 30% sweet which was perfect!","444":"Terrible store service, they don't even turn the A\/C on in the store in this weather... humid and hard to breath inside. Worry about the material they use in this conduction. we used to love this store....","445":"I did enjoy the winter melon milk tea....as I happily suck on the last bits of soft boba, I saw a strand of hair stuck to the inside of the cup. I froze in horror because I was trying to get past the thought that I was drinking milk tea soaked in someone else's hair. How dare you Sharetea for ruining my love for milk tea?!!!! Thanks to you, i have given up drinking milk tea for life....well, at least for now.","446":"Heard this was good place for bubble tea. It's pretty good.  Like this place better then other places nearby. Weekends they get packed but the line moves.  We liked it. Good place","447":"Went there couple weeks ago asked for \"Okinawa milk tea, with less ice\". The gave me a regular milk tea and 3\/4 cup of ice inside the drink. I asked them why I have that much ice while I asked for less ice. They said its \"less\" and the tea is \"Hot\". The ice didn't melt until two and half hours after. I didn't aware that is a regular milk tea after drove away from that plaza. The too icy and diluted regular milk tea is really ruin the whole drink.  Never go back there again. There are more places to go in that plaza.","448":"Terrible service, got order wrong, did not give stamp card for credit either\nTaste is subpar. Tea tastes diluted\nWait time was ridiculous for the time, 20 mins for two drinks","449":"I really enjoyed the tea here! I had milk tea with tapioca. The only reason they get 4 stars is because I waited 15 minutes for my tea and only one person had ordered before me.","450":"Relatively new bubble tea place compared to others in China town. Only had it a few times. Generally I'm not impressed but remember getting too much tapioca\/boba (over half the cup) once and it ruined that cup of milk tea... My friends added jelly instead of boba and those seems fine. Will try other drinks if I'm around.","451":"So I saw a post on Facebook from a friend sharing pictures of the new drink in a lightbulb and I was super excited that it was finally in Houston. I made it a mission to come out and try the drink. Well when I got there I was discouraged by the employees to try it who asked me if I was sure if I wanted it...and then the girl at the counter makes a rude comment to my best friend who didn't order the drink saying \"thanks for not ordering the lightbulb drink.\" I was super excited to share this concept on my blog but I didn't appreciate being treated so poorly. I hate writing bad reviews but when you have the staff being that rude I think it's something everyone should know before walking in. SO if you do decided to try this place don't get the lightbulb drink. The only reason I'm giving it two stars was because the drink was good just poor service. Don't offer a product if your employees are going to be lazy!","452":"Edit: 2\/24\/2016 very slow service. Not enough employees. Took 23 mins to get two reg black teas out. \n\n\n\nIt was good during their buy one get one free offer. Got ripped off because ordered a $5 drink and got the black milk tea at full sugar worth $3 free. Probably give them another try in a few months. The drinks we ordered had a thick milky cream on top that was really really sweet and just made the mango drink taste weird. Thenmilk tea (free) was premade and overloaded with ice. I bet if you took out all the ice and poured the liquids into ONE cup, it would all fit. Just saying that I don't think this is his business should be done. OK that is my two cents.","453":"After the bad visit my first time, I didn't come back until a month later. So, this is a waaaaay overdue review. But, came back with my family and needless to say, I enjoyed the drink. I got the Okinawa milk tea with boba and it was really good! My sister got the Taro Milk tea with egg pudding, boba, and qq (don't know the full name, but it's on a board somewhere haha). I liked her drink better, they had these little taro bits, egg pudding, and boba. It was really good, but a little too sweet for my liking. Whenever I come by next time, I would get it with less sugar.","454":"I am so happy that there is a Sharetea here in Houston! Living in SoCal, I usually go to the one in San Gabriel for my mango green tea creama fix. Now I can get my fix here when I'm visiting my fam in Htown. I was pleasantly surprised when I walked into the store. The design was very simple and the store was so spacious and clean. The staff was really nice too, which is unlike the typical service you get in Chinatown. I'm definitely coming back here the next time I am in town.","455":"So I've been going back to share tea a lot because of their matcha green tea creama! I just can't get enough of it. The tapioca is the right amount of sweet and squishy. It can get crowded here sometimes but it's so worth it. The environment of the place is very welcoming and i'm never disappointed when I come!","456":"There is a pleasant tea aroma when I walked in. I ordered the Okinawa and it has such unique flavors which I had never had at any other tea place. The amount of sweetness is perfect! the tapioca was on point( not overcook nor undercook) and they gave me plenty of it. The cashier asked me the amount of ice I wanted and offer me stamp cards. At other tea places that I've been to, no one has ever ask me the amount of ice I wanted. I usually have to ask them myself. The price is reasonable compare to other tea places around the area. I would definitely come back and try other things on the menu.","457":"I definitely found my new tapioca spot. The environment is nicely lit and spacious. It looks like a good place to study and it's not too loud. The drinks are delicious! My friend and I got oolong milk tea and a winter melon, both with fresh milk. You get to choose your sugar and ice level, which is really neat. The tapioca balls are perfect in my opinion. In the end the pricing is cheaper than kung fu tea house, but the quality is equal or even better.","458":"Perfect 5\/7, their mango creama is hands down my favorite drink! I have tried a lot of the other tea places in China town and Houston,  and their stuff is the good stuff.","459":"Would be 4 stars but the need more than 1 register\n\nQQ is good if you like a lot of diff flavors\n\nStrawberry ice blended is good\n\nThey split drinks for $0.50","460":"I'm always surprised at business that have such polarized reviews. My wife and I have been to Sharetea since they opened, including once during their soft opening. Our experience has been consistent. Good customer service, nice decor and delicious drinks. Their Creama definitely set them apart from the dozen or so other milktea places in the area. However, their high mountain oolong milktea is just as good as Teabar's, which is kind of a compliment because it's our current favorite.","461":"My boyfriend and I came here today after running errands to grab something to drink because it was just wayyyyy too hot outside. He kept telling me about the wintermelon tea with sea salt cream which sounded pretty interesting to try. So when we got there, he went ahead and ordered that drink and since I was wanting something more refreshing rather than creamy, I got the Hawaii fruit tea. I can say for sure that they were both way way wayyyy too sweet to even be considered refreshing in a hot, humid day in Houston; and on top of that, there was barely any ice in our drinks. Don't get me wrong, the flavors were great, hence why I'm giving them 3 stars but the sweetness was overbearing. We had to go home, put more ice into the drink and more water just to level out the sweetness. I'll go back for the wintermelon with sea salt cream for sure but I will remember to possibly ask for more ice and less sugar.","462":"Not my favorite place for boba. The teas here taste too herbal for my liking. The tapioca is great and chewy though.","463":"Good taste of tea n friendly staff.  I tried the Okinawa milk tea.  Basically, I can't really consider its tea but a flavor drink that so sweet.  The only bad thing about ordering those special drinks is that you can't choose the level of sweetness.","464":"Prices are very good and my drink came out fast. The drink itself was perfect, they asked me for sugar levels and I chose half sweet. I got winter melon with fresh milk and the drink had the right amount of sweetness to it. Highly recommend this place","465":"This place is my second favorite milk tea place in Houston. I prefer Kung Fu Tea for the ambience, but the actual tea at Sharetea is better :D","466":"Update: Service is 10x better! Everyone is quick, but doesn't lose quality or customer service. The cashiers are pretty friendly too. The drinks are still on point. Boba is soft, but still chewy. I'm here almost every single weekend! Current favorites and suggestions: Okinawa Milk Tea = bomb af, but generally all their milk teas are good.","467":"My review is going to be based off of the two times I've been here. First, let's talk about the interior. The interior design is very modern, neat, and clean. Their restroom is a definitely five star! It's so clean despite being located in Chinatown. Aside from their interior, their staff is well educated and very friendly. I'm glad that I'm able to receive excellent customer service in Chinatown. As for their drinks, I highly recommend the creme green tea or the winter melon black tea with lemon. If I had to compare their drinks to other boba places in Chinatown, I'd have to describe their drinks leaning more towards the tea side while a lot of the other boba places highly depend on syrup and powder. If you prefer your boba drink to lean more towards the tea side or taste more like tea rather than a dessert, this is the place to go to!","468":"I'm glad I live in H-town! A bunch of bubble tea places opening up, especially in this same shopping plaza too. I've had Sharetea in Korea, plus I'm Taiwanese soo I've known about this place for awhile now :p The drinks made here are really flavorful, and very unique too. I'm a milk tea kinda girl, so I've had the Okinawa milk tea which has roasted brown sugar in it, which tastes awesome! Hokkaido milk tea is also a good choice, because of the caramel toffee which I'm not really a fan of caramel BUT this doesn't have that strong caramel taste as you would expect so its yummy! I like it! The QQ happy family milk tea is like a regular milk tea, but with all of the toppings you can imagine in it! The most unique thing on their menu I would say is their Creama drinks. I got the strawberry creama drink that tasted like I was eating a strawberry cheesecake :) You get a little plastic knife which you cut slits in each side of your lid, because the cream doesn't settle fully in the bottom so you can sip the cream on one side to enjoy and your straw on the other side. I've been here way too much my punch card is almost full...anyways their staff is super nice and will give you good recommendations if your unsure what to get! Another bonus is you can use your credit card on one drink without a minimum of like $10 like other places I've been too. Try this place if you've never been, you won't be disappointed.","469":"Been there twice. Both times my drink took 15 minutes to make. So the first time, I understand since it was opening weekend. However, the 2nd time I went there, there were only 4 tables of people and all of them already got their drinks before I went inside. For some reason, my drink still took 15 minutes. I have never gone back since. Teahouse down the street on Ranchester is just as good and they're super fast.","470":"The tea have that freshly brewed taste, very similar to Gongcha for a little by cheaper price tag","471":"Not your typical tapioca place since they don't have Thai tea or Jasmine Milk Tea, however, the drinks are really good and unique. My favorites are the Okinawa Milk Tea, Hokkaido Milk Tea which has a caramel toffee flavor, the Black Pearl Milk Tea and the Coffee Milk Tea! When ordering, be sure to let them know the sweetness level that you would like and if you want boba in your drink or not, otherwise they won't put any. Sometimes they do run out of boba or a specific drink which kinda sucks BUT they do have stamp cards which is definitely a bonus because who doesn't like a free drink every now and then?!","472":"I'm officially addicted... I've been resisting and have been thinking of the Okinawa for over 5hrs.....now I'm in line!!! The Okinawa is my favorite and the real taro in fresh milk is another good one. I can't even drink my old milk tea places now....","473":"We've gotten tea here twice now and it was delicious both times. The tapioca had great texture and flavor.","474":"Tried matcha green tea creama. Not a whole lot of matcha taste, taste only cream and sugar. Disappointing and there were no tapiocas. Little bit pricey. Wouldn't come back.","475":"Nice and clean, those drinks are very good. But I just can barely understand the cashier when she took my order. She talked too fast and not very clearly.","476":"Awesome service, awesome place. Clean, and such a cute place. \n\nTry oolong tea with fresh milk or oolong milk tea if you prefer the creamer taste. I have converted all my friends to come here instead Kung Fu, so happy I no longer have to take those stinky attitudes!!!","477":"This place is great ! The employee was helpful and sweet not like the norm of rude Asians in this shopping center lol. I ordered the oolong creama it was good but different bc it was more creamer and thicker . I actually like it ! The lady that delivered my drink was so sweet and told me thank you and have a nice day ! :)","478":"Another milk tea place that accepts card or doesn't charge extra for the transaction. I have been avoiding this place until now because it just opened and people were complaining about the wait time but when I came it was super fast and easy to get my drink and best of all it was really good! My favorite is the black pearl milk tea. Just the right balance between tea and milk. I'll probably get it a little less sweet next time though. Overall, there's nothing really special about this new place but it's not bad compared to many other places either. I would choose this over some of the neighboring (like next door) boba places.","479":"As a frequent regular of tapioca house, I decided to Try sharetea recently and had the green tea crema, honey black tea, matcha crema, and wintermelon tea. Boba consistency was too chewy for me. I prefer my boba to be more softer but still chewy as well. Drinks were pretty good especially the crema teas but the wait is ridiculously long. Staff here has great customer service. They're always busy and fully staffed in the back but they aren't making drinks fast enough. Perhaps they are new and still trying to learn the ropes but the wait for a Saturday night was roughly 20 mins. 2\/3 of the times I visited they were either out of regular bobas or baby bobas :\/.","480":"i think i found my new study spot! nice clean tables next to outlets in a roomy spacious and clean modern interior with clean bathrooms is definitely more conducive to studying than kung fu.\nas for the drinks, i wanted to try something different than my usual and opted for hot ginger milk tea with boba. boba tasted a little mushy but that might be due to the heat of my drink; i ordered it half sweet and it was still pretty sweet, i'd probably get a cavity if i had ordered full sweetness....ginger bits were a nice surprise in my drink, and it kept me warm and awake and was served in a cute lid sealed insulated cup!\nthis place was packed when we came at 3pm on a weekday; i will say they are slow to get through the line and slow to get drinks out. but i like how the whole drink making isn't hidden, instead its right behind the counter for everyone to see. \nyou'll definitely see me here during exam weeks!","481":"I frequent here either with friends or by myself on the occasion. The joint is usually packed to the brim on busy days such as Saturday. The place itself has a modern and clean decor and the same goes for its restroom so sitting here just chatting with friends is often an enjoyable experience. The only problem I've ever had with this place is when I went with my parents to get some tap. Took over an hour to get our drinks (seriously, my dad watched his watch several times as he was chatting with my mom). It was on a Sunday morning though so it was pretty understandable also with the fact that my family had a lot of time. Overall a great place to get tapioca. Try the winter melon tea with milk and boba!","482":"Give this place a four star and this is why, I came and ordered the classic black milk tea. When I received it, it was clearly off color. The staff even noticed the discoloration in the milk tea and gave it to me anyways, I tried it and just as I thought it was awful. I decided to make a complaint and the staff gladly remade my drink and did admit that the milk tea was made horribly. Nonetheless after the drink was made again it was delicious! I came back again the next day and tried the other milk tea (okinawa milk tea) that was also very delicious. I would definitely come back again, considering I came during their soft opening It shouldn't be held against them that the drink was made wrong once.","483":"God damn ridiculous I ordered my drink with no line, and it took them 40 minutes to make one drink. Really 40 f minutes! With 6 workers and 1 boss I think behind the bar how many does it take to make 1 Qq milk tea. And it straight up taste so powdery. Sorry but cafe 101 and tea bar taste way better than your drinks even for 40 minute. Low quality tea it literally taste like Lipton tea.","484":"I was almost addicted to their seasonal almond milk tea drink when I first tried it. However, the second time did not taste nearly as good as the first time and we were also disappointed with their other tea drinks. I couldn't remember the name of the other drink that we ordered but I remember really disliking the taro. Taro fans please do not order their Taro drinks, it was basically bland pieces of cut up taro in some milk tea and ice. We are making a conscious effort to avoid this place.","485":"I like this place. My palate is on the more plain side when it comes to drinks (im not a fan of savory drinks). This place has a good option for a refreshing drink without compromising too much stomach room. Environment, staff and, cleanliness are great.","486":"I am addicted to the high mountain creama but 30 minutes for one drink when the place isn't crowded.. Sad to say I'm crawling back to Mr. Sassy pants @kungfu :(( and they told me they're discontinuing the high mountain as well. The service is usually awesome but as of lately the wait is unbearable!","487":"Really like their ginger milk tea and personally I don't like my drink too sweet, i always pick 50% sugar and its so good","488":"So KungFu Tea is my usually go to spot for boba in the Chinatown area, but I think my friend might have converted me to a ShareTea fan. She had been talking about the place for a week or two now and how it's so popular in Asia, that I thought I'd finally give it a try. Can't remember the exact milk tea that I ordered, but all I know is that it was made very well. They are also VERY generous with the amount of boba they add to the drinks. My friend ordered her drink with the egg pudding, which had the most perfect texture to it that I'm definitely getting that next time! They offered us samples of some of their regular tea (I wasn't much of a fan). The place is pretty spacious and the employees were really nice in explaining all of the available options. I'll probably be back again soon!","489":"The girl at the front was nice & helpful. To me everything tastes the same as other places. The creama is something unique that I've never heard of before. My friend seemed to like it. They give you a little plastic blade to cut a slit into the cup so you can sip on the drink. We later put the blade on top of a straw and made a shank. Pretty awesome :)","490":"I don't know where the good common come from. My friends n me ordered 4 different drinks, all taste bad! The quality of tea is really bad. And the drinks are too sweet even I already asked for 30 percent sugar. I tried sharetea in New York before, it was great, but here...I don't recommend at all!","491":"This is probably my favorite place to go for milk tea. I used to think the crema is a little too salty but now I'm addicted! The line could get pretty long at nights and on weekends though.","492":"Don't think I'll ever come back here again or anytime soon.. \n\n1st time:\nI heard it was good and the hype was real for this place so my siblings and I decided to give it a try. After much contemplation,  I listened to the worker at the register and got the fresh taro milk with tapioca. I understood the wait was going to be awhile since it's a new place and it was fairly packed but.... 45 minutes??? COME. ON. After 20 minutes, it was weird because other orders after me got theirs but yet we were still waiting for ours. They said they ran out of tapioca and had to boil it. Understandable. My siblings got their drinks after 30 minutes. But since I ordered tapioca I had to wait the additional 15..after checking up on them and asking for my drink probably at least 2 times to remind them to make it or if they forgot. To which they kept saying the tapioca was still cooking. Okay. When I finally got my drink, it was terrible. I saw them take fresh taro, blend it, put it into the cup, add fresh whole milk and tapioca. I guess I should've known to not expect much when ordering \"fresh taro milk\"\nThe tapioca was fresh, which was relieving, but flavorless. I could've done without it had I known it wasn't going to be anything special. \n\n2nd chance: I came around 10pm on a Wednesday and they ran out of tapioca. Just my luck. But this time I decided to go with the typical regular taro milk tea (plus egg pudding) to see if I could turn a new leaf and change my opinion about them. Nope. the drink was super creamy..and not in a good way. I felt like I was chugging whipping cream or half and half milk. Bleh. I went home and diluted it with some water.","493":"I just tried the Brown Sugar Milk Tea and honestly I have never tasted anything worse than this. The tapioca is undercooked and chewy. The tea is plain. It was trashed immediately. I'm definitely not going back.","494":"Love! May be my new favorite bubble tea place in Houston (I've been loyal to tapioca house for 8 years now!)\n\nThey're pretty new so it seems they are training their employees so service is extremely slow (I waited 20 min to order on a Friday at 1pm with 5 people ahead of me). I ordered the classic milk tea with bubbles with less ice and half sugar, but my 50% sugar tasted as sweet as a full sugar at tapioca house ... So just be warned! (Ps. You can customize your order at other places in the same way when though not advertised: sugar and ice amounts)\n\nOverall. I'll be adding this place to my bubble tea rotation because it's fantastic! \n\nI'll update to 5 stars once they get faster on wait time.","495":"Mmmm just the hype. Got the classic oolong milk tea and the tapioca was very good and chewy but the tea lacked strong tea flavor. Maybe it was the way they mixed the strong tea with the older tea? Not sure but I'll try it again until I say a definite \"I won't be back\"","496":"This place is much more roomier compare to other tea places, it seems like a great place to study. I ordered the Green Classic Milk tea while my husband and his friend ordered the Mango Green Tea & Coffee Milk Tea. I got my drink with 50% less sugar and it tasted like I should have just gone with 100% sugar. The other drinks were good, real good. But tea bar will always be my favorite!","497":"Tried this place 3 different times and every time I return, I'm left disappointed. With all the competition in the plaza, let alone right next door, they definitely need to step up their game. I found their teas to be overly sweet and all have a weird after taste. Don't get me wrong though,the decor is great and I like the ambiance more than the other tap spots in the plaza. There are plenty of tables, the entire is very well lit, and it's very clean. I still don't wanna give up on this place. I plan on returning to try more of their drinks to hopefully find one that I like!","498":"ok, but the price is on the higher end. \nbetter than a lot of the other tapioca places nearby. this is definitely in the top 5 in the bellaire shopping strip. id give it a B rating. lol","499":"Good customer service with awesome drinks. If you go to milk tea,  make sure you try their creama.","500":"Tasty milk teas, very customizable drinks (eg level of sweetness, amount of ice), and some of the best pearls I've had! Even though the name is SHAREtea, you may not want to share because it's so good! The cafe also has a decent amount of seating for those who want to go there to hang out with friends. \n\nSo why not 5 stars? The first time we went, there were only a few people in front of us in line and it took 30+ min to order and get our drink. Second time we went, the wait was a reasonable 10 min but they were out of regular pearls. We got the mini pearls instead, which still had good flavor and texture, but they weren't as good as regular sized pearls. A bubble tea place should not run out of bubbles! If they can get all their ducks in a row and be consistent in speed and inventory management, I'd be happy to give them 5 stars.","501":"Wow, I think I might have found a new to-go place for my milk tea.  First time around I got the Okinawa milk tea.  At first I wasn't sure how I would like it, but after a few sips, it was a very delightful taste.  I had the Oolong milk tea the other day and didn't like it as much.  Guess it tasted a little bland for me.  But the boba is made perfectly.  Nice chewiness and sweetness.  Drinks around around $4.33 including tax which I used to think was a lot, but I think the price fits for its authenticity.  You won't taste the powdered stuff here.","502":"This review is based only on their drinks.\n\nI've been to sharetea a few times only to be disappointed over and over again. I thought maybe this time I would get lucky and find something I actually like from here since my friend wanted to come here....wrong. (I should've trusted my guts because now they hurt from the sugar overload)\n\nIf you're into milk tea that's drowned in sugar\/syrup even after asking for it to be 50% sweet, then you'll probably like this place. Couldn't even taste the flavor of tea in my drink since it was masked with sugar. I'm never the one to complain because I know what's it like to be behind the register, but my drink was not drinkable because of how sweet it was. I asked if there's any way they could remake my drink. The guy behind the register said he could only add more ice or dilute with water (which I thought was weird since every where else you could probably get your drink remade, but I know it's probably not his rule since he's just a worker) As he was diluting it with water I heard the girl working with him whisper \"I didn't even put any sugar in it.\" Well it has to be SOMETHING that's making it overly sweet   it was still way too sweet after being diluted with water, and my friend agreed also after she had a sip of mine. Diabetes in a cup that's all I got to say.\n\nMy stomach hurts now from the 4 sips I had before throwing it away.","503":"I can only speak to their milk tea, as I don't care as much for the other types of drinks, but I think they might be the best in Chinatown that I've experienced (the top few are all relatively close quality, tbh).\n\nI've tried 4 types so far:\n- Holiday Almond Cream (or something like that): Has actual almond bits in it and is creamier than typical, which is nifty, but the almonds kinda disrupt the drinking more than they enhance it.\n- Normal Milk Tea: I think they do a great job getting the sugar, cream, and tea proportions down to my liking. A lot of places in Chinatown can be too sweet or too watered down, but they seem to get it just right.\n- Okinawa Milk Tea: They use roasted brown sugar I believe instead of regular sugar, and I actually really liked it! The hint from the roast adds a new dimension to the drink that I had never had before, so I'll definitely get it again when I'm in the mood.\n- Hokkaido Milk Tea: I don't recall what the substitution was for this one. A bit of an oddball, though I wouldn't say it tastes bad. I could see how this could appeal to some people though.\n\nThe tapioca balls are also well made and have flavor (which many places overlook) and are proper texture and chewiness.","504":"Coming from California where I grew up, I've been mostly disappointed by Houston's selection of boba tea. Sharetea changed my mind. Not only is this the best milk tea in Houston, it's my favorite, period. (Later learned there are also Shareteas in California!)\n\nTheir teas are very flavorful (I could identify at least four or five distinct flavor tones), and the boba is just the right texture and consistency. Plain milk tea is amazing. I also tried and loved the Okinawa. The lines are usually out the door, but it's totally worth it. This is the one place I'm willing to wait a ridiculous amount of time for. It's that amazing.\n\nAlso, they're really friendly and chill about my friends studying there in the afternoon. To avoid crowds, I'd recommend going between 1 and 5 or so.","505":"Out of the many boba shops in bellaire itself I think this place lands 4th place in my book. I love jasmine milk tea boba and that's all I'm ever going to order going to a boba place. No fruity drinks I don't do that shit. And I look for chewiness when it comes to boba balls and this place got it. The milk it's alright but it's majority water to me.","506":"got the honey milk tea with tapioca and the matcha red bean with ice cream. the honey milk tea was okay, you can taste the honey but the tea itself was rather bland. I had the same issue with the matcha drink. It didn't taste anywhere as flavorful or sweet as sweetened matcha is suppose to taste. service was okay, they got the drinks out in about 15 min when the place was pretty busy, but the girl at the counter called our ticket number and had no idea where my matcha drink was! I had to literally tell her it was the one someone else was still sealing :I\nthe only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because I rather enjoyed the tapioca pearls. I don't think I'll be returning when theres so many other better bubble tea places in Chinatown.","507":"I definitely recommend this place. Matcha Green Tea Creama is really good. Clean and friendly staff.","508":"In my opinion, one of the only boba places in Houston that is a step above. Coming from California, I am quite picky about my boba teas. This place has great variety, but I like to stick with the normal milk tea. This time, I tried oolong instead of the generic black tea. I added pearls and herbal jelly, ordered 50% sweetness, and less ice. The sweetness level was perfect for me, as the tea flavor truly came through. This place does not skimp on the sinkers! I actually got tired of chewing the pearls. Overall, a great boba place with decent prices.","509":"Finally try share tea and they are now my favorite teahouse.  Worth the wait in line for their oolong milktea. Their mango green tea is really good too. They don't use syrup, instead it's a mango fruit jam so there's actually mango chunks in the drink. Just go, run now! It will blow all the other teahouse away.","510":"New place in town! The tea and boba is ok! But the waiting time is terrible! More than 30 minute wait for just a drink! And no place to seat! \n\nHope they can improve that!","511":"I bought the first drink when it started grand opening and kept loving it until yesterday 6\/11\/16. I ordered matcha green tea creama with tapioca (my second favorite order), it tasted terrible (no tea flavor at all), I complained they said because of  milk, cream...i don't want to urge for 5$ drink so i decided to throw it to trash can. I thought it could go wrong one time. I ordered one Okinawa drink (my most favorite drink), now i have to tell it like shit with no tea flavor at all (note these 2 are one of most strong tea flavor). I asked my friends order 2 orders of tea drink only but turned completely off to us. Last, if you come here and stay until last business minute, you are in serious conversation with your friend, they cut you all off by turning freaking loudly music on to kick all of you out of the store. In my opinion, it's nice to let people know 10' before you close. They will leave without delay your business.  It's time to say good bye to this business!","512":"We came here during their grand opening, the place is beautiful and seem very clean. We ordered the classic milk tea (w black tea), it came out really plain and tasteless. Of course i returned it, they were than happy to remake our milk tea. The second time was much better but still average compared to other boba placea.","513":"The matcha milk tea with red bean is the best I've ever tasted. This place is ALWAYS super busy but is worth the wait. It's convenient they don't have a card transaction limit too. Very high quality milk tea. Will be coming here for that matcha milk tea often!!","514":"This is the only place I go to for tea these days. I get the Okinawa every time. I love it. They are a lot more efficient than when they first opened. I still try to avoid peak hours. The line can be long and service can take a while. The staff is friendly.","515":"Best milk tea in town, hands down! I tried several shops in Houston and this is the best by a mile. It is even comparable with the milk tea shops in Shanghai. Strong recommendation!","516":"When I saw the Sharetea logo put up in the plaza months ago, I couldn't wait for grand opening. After my visit, I couldn't be more disappointed. I had Sharetea before in California, but this location does not match up at all.\n\nService was extremely slow. With only about 6 people in front of us, it took 30 mins to get our 2 drinks. They were only running one cash register.\n\nRan out of large boba around noon! How can you let this happen, especially as a new competitor in this plaza? They had mini boba, but it's not the same. Milk tea was almost all cream, barely any tea flavor.\n\nTwo stars because I believe in second chances. Will give this place one last chance to redeem themselves, probably once the new hype settles down a little more.","517":"Tastes good to me. High mountain with fresh milk and 30% sugar. Pretty solid showing.","518":"So excited that they open in Houston. Had their milk tea in SF. Like their clean and simple style. Very nice staffs and service. Red bean milk is my favorite.","519":"This place is pretty spacious and seems like a good place to chill or study, and I would give it 4 stars, but the drinks are not to my liking-- I got a green tea with fresh milk and tapioca and my husband got a coffee crema. We were both pretty underwhelmed and neither of us finished our drinks. Even though I got a fresh milk tea, my drink still had an edge of sourness to it, to the point that I couldn't tell if they had cross-contaminated the milk with the crema (which I had sampled) or  whether the \"fresh milk\" just wasn't so fresh. The guy behind the counter was really nice and friendly to us, and explained the entire menu and all. The lighting in the place is so incredibly bright that just being there fatigued my eyes. It's worth a visit if you are interested in drinks that are sort of salty and strange-tasting and\/or you need to do something that requires insanely bright light.","520":"I ordered milk tea with herb jelly, 30%sugar and light ice, it's pretty close the taste from Taipei, strong tea aroma and tasty jelly, the only pros it's too pricy $4.00 for this drink and it's still over sweet on the 30% level.","521":"It was my first time and I tried the Hawaii tea with lychee jelly and 30% sweetness and little ice. It was heavenly.. good strong flavor with chunks of fruit that made it super delicious. Next time I will get it with no added sugar and I'm sure it will be perfect. My friend got strawberry slush with ice cream and would've gotten another if not for the long line that developed! Definitely will be back again.","522":"I really love the drinks here but Please , cashier ! be nice and smile to customers!!!!","523":"Has the matcha milk tea with taro 50% sweet. The amount of sweetness was just right and the taro was just the right amount chewy but not too chewy. I felt guilty drinking the milk tea since it means my time on the treadmill was wasted but oh so worth it.","524":"Long wait but the tea is pretty good. Lines can get pretty long. I recommend the QQ happy family it's a mixture of toppings.","525":"I've had a couple drinks here, and I just think they're ok.  I think, for me, I do not like the flavor that using brown sugar adds.  I would buy a drink here again, but it wouldn't be my first choice.","526":"So I told the cashier that I wanted no sugar. He didn't order it like that so my drink had full sugar. They told me I would have to buy another one if I wanted no sugar.","527":"I've had Sharetea once before in California and thought it was just okay, but now I realize that I just got the wrong drink for me back then. I went on a Saturday around 2pm and the line was ridiculously long. After getting my drink (overall I would say the entire ordeal took about 30 minutes?) though, I had to grudgingly admit that it was pretty darn good and kinda worth the wait since I really didn't have anything planned anyway... \n\nI got the whole lemon green tea (less ice, 80% sugar, and both aloe vera and pearls since I figured I deserved two for waiting), and it was amazing. The drink is exactly how it sounds - there's literally a whole lemon floating in the tea, so if you're not into sour, then I'd highly recommend NOT getting this. If, on the other hand, you like the taste of lemon and are not afraid of some sourness, then I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this. Maybe because of the whole lemon, or maybe because of the less ice, but there was still an amazing amount of flavor at the very very end, even though I left it sitting for a while because I was working on other things! Also, if you've never gotten aloe vera as a topping (this was my first time seeing it, so I figured I had to give it a whirl), I would definitely recommend that too. The texture was great and had just the right amount of sweetness to complement the sourness of the drink.","528":"Overall the drinks here are above-average quality. They can control the exactly sugar level since they got the machine to help them make drinks. But there was a day me and my friend got two over sweet drinks but we ask for half sugar when we order. That took-off one star.  Also, the biggest problem, make drink faster, please. I have to wait for 20 min for two drinks when there was no customer. The employees inside the counter were talking about something else when they make drinks. They make fun of each other, then laugh, then find out the next step they have to do. The girl who scoop boba in my two cups scoop for more than two minute. Omg did you scoop each boba individually? I was really speechless to saw these when I stand next to the counter to wait for my drinks. These even didn't make me feel that good when I drink my milk tea. Do not come here if you are in hurry. But if you are ok to wait, it is not a bad choice in this milk tea kingdom plaza.","529":"No lines and long wait times my second trip here.  My first time here, my thoughts were \"Meh!  Maybe it's not all that great because of the hustle and bustle of the first day of opening.\"  I'll try again!\n\nSecond trip here... Ok so no excuses, maybe it really is just \"Mehhh!\" I ordered the black milk tea both trips.  First trip I ordered it with boba and grass jelly, second trip I ordered it with grass jelly and egg pudding.  The tea lacked flavor, the egg pudding had no taste but the boba and herbal jelly were pretty good.  While waiting for my drink on my second trip here, I did notice how they were scooping the jelly and pudding into my cup.  Scoop of egg pudding... Scoop of jelly *takes a look at the cup* then, another tiny scoop of jelly *looks at cup again* then scoops some of the jelly out (repeat x 3)........... OMFG!  Can you really be that frugal?!!  You would think they had some practice runs and figured out how many scoops of add-ons to use per serving.. Ridiculous!  I'm pretty sure the person that made my drink spent at least 2 mins scooping my add-ons in and out while eye-balling it.  For now, I'll avoid this place and give them some room for improvement.  Sad, sad.","530":"I've been going to Sharetea almost weekly since its opening but was treated terribly by the staff today after a disagreement about our order. To make matters worse, both of our drinks tasted very subpar compared to our past drinks here. I wouldn't be surprised if this was done intentionally.","531":"They really like to let the customers waiting in line!! I'm standing right here for 3 minutes, and nobody takes my orders.","532":"It takes 30min to get in the door and place an order. The person taking orders is also helping  out on the side adding pearls to each drink, in between orders. If the line is 30min long and hot as hell outside why would you not have the person in front fully focus on taking orders? I have already seen a group of 5-6 people leave since the line was so long. And the only reason I'm buying here is because my wife prefers this store. I certainly wouldn't.","533":"Well to start, Sharetea is a nice contemporary styled store in Chinatown. The first time I expected them to have loads of bubble tea flavors, but they only had one bubble tea flavor, \"milk bubble tea\" which came in other tastes like green tea, (other than bubble tea flavors they had lots of fruit drinks if you like that). So, I went I requested a classic milk tea with boba (Like I had a choice),  and the cashier was nice asked me how much ice I wanted and the sweetness level I liked, (I got less ice and 80% sweetness which was perfect for me). Anyways, the next time I went it was the totally different, The cashier lady didn't ask me anything about the ice or sweetness I wanted, as if it didn't exist and was about to check me out before I got to tell her, (It was like she hoped I didn't know and was too lazy to ask) so I told her myself, I requested a green milk tea with boba. My drink was ready, and you know when you look at your drink and see the many black balls of smiling delicious boba that you know you will be chewing on? Well my drink didn't have those delicious black balls. And that's when I literally was going to cry, Whats bubble tea without the bubbles?? I guess the cashier didn't ask me so she assumed I didn't want, though I said \"May I have green milk bubble tea please\".weird. So, I drank my tea without the bubbles because I didn't want to pay again or have to wait again and was already in quite a hurry to get to my brother next door. So about to be late to my brother ,I went next door to the organic tea place on the right, and sat with my brother  and siped quietly at my bubbless tea. Then the organic worker lady came and said rudely \"Sorry Mam, no outside drinks\" (Does she know that im already mentally broken down because of my bubbless tea???) Then she takes my drink and puts into one of their cups, (I think she did Sharetea a favor!). So there you have it,  drinking bobaless Sharetea in and Organic Tea cup....","534":"One of the best boba teas! The boba is soft and the milk tea is very flavorful. You can adjust the sweetness and ice level, which I really like. The price is very reasonable for the quality and quantity you get. My classic pearl milk tea with black tea was delicious!","535":"Their tea is very good. I ended up getting one of the teas with creama. The female cashier was very nice and so was the guy who gave me my drink and explained how to drink it. I thought the price was also fairly good compared to other tea houses.","536":"They were very very generous with tapioca in my milk tea and the matcha red bean milk tea is also really delicious  short wait too","537":"As with most tapioca places, it's either great, or really bad. With Sharetea, you can taste the freshness of their ingredients. The boba is tasteful and the chewiness is just right. However, some of their drinks can be extremely sweet -- like their taro ice blended cream tea. I don't really like sweets so the taste was quite overwhelming for me. For those who are looking for a subtle kick of milk tea, this place is definitely for you. I've tried the Hokkaido Milk Tea, the Okinawa Milk Tea, the Taro Milk Tea, and the QQ Happy Family Milk Tea. Their drinks can be on the pricey side, but the quality of the flavor really shines so it's worth it. For those who enjoy variety, I strongly urge the QQ Happy Family Milk Tea. It has jelly, boba, and egg pudding in the drink. Did I forget to mention that they also put red beans in some of their drinks (in replacement of boba)? It's pretty great. Overall, I would recommend this place as it's different from other boba-tapioca places. Additionally, they take credit card without a minimum fee, and even more, they take AMERICAN EXPRESS! This is definitely my go-to spot most of the time. I've probably stamped my Sharetea card like 20 times by now. #diabetes","538":"This place has the best milk tea.  Flavorful tea.  Adjust to your taste sweetness.  Boba has the best texture and consistency.  Perfecto!","539":"This place is just your average teahouse, nothing special. More or less same prices as surrounding teahouses, and more or less same quality. Honestly, I would just flip a coin when deciding whether to go here or somewhere else like Honey Bee or Teabar.
