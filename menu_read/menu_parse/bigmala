food and service. This place has been popping up all over Houston & well deserved. \n\nThe portions are big, perfect family style restaurant. \n\nEverything I've tried here has been on point, haven't been disappointed yet. \n\nPersonal favorite is the water boiled fish! It's amazing and melts in your mouth. My bf loves their spicy crispy chicken. \n\nThis a must try in Chinatown!","1":"Came here for an early dinner on a Wednesday night. Was able to be seated quickly and was served my food incredibly fast. \n\nHaving just moved to Texas I was excited for my for Sichuan meal, so far it's been the cuisine I've missed the most from NYC. Given the extensive menu I decided to go big on the appetizer and have a sizable entree so I'd have plenty for the next day. \n\nI decided to start with the Dan Dan Noodles after seeing so many reviews rave about them. The noodles had a great consistency and the seasoning\/sauce had a great chili oil type kick. While it could have used a little more meat, it had a great peppery flavor that meshed well with the sauce. \n\nI went with the Kung pao chicken as my entree as it was the closest item on the menu to my usual Sichuan pepper chicken. I definitely enjoyed it, but it was lacking in that classic peppercorn taste (I didn't experience that light numbing sensation I usually would) despite no lack of peppers on the dish. The chicken was nice and tender and I liked that there were a ton of peanuts. \n\nOverall, I could definitely see myself coming here repeatedly if I lived in the area as their menu had a lot of creative items centered around different peppers and seasonings I've enjoyed at my previous Sichuan experiences. I'd recommend coming with a group so you can share a few different dishes. Also be sure to come hungry as even the 7$ noodle appetizer was big enough that I could see some people calling it a meal after!","2":"This place has good dishes. But did not like the Masa fish Tofu. It's a huge no no. Too oily for my taste and the fish taste is not the best. Actually, worse fish ever. \nBut I do recommend the Duck Dan Dan noodles. \nAnd the Ants in the Tree plates is very tasty. Very tasty. So tasty I wanted more, but I couldn't. I was so full. \nOne more thing that I wanted was probably a sauce for the duck. Tea leave roasted duck is naturally dry. But soft. And also very tasty, like Bbq from Asia. \nIt gets a 5 stars for timing.","3":"Mala Sichuan Bistro likens itself to be a modern Sichuanese restaurant and based on my experiences there, I would be inclined to agree. As one of the more popular Chinese establishments in Houston, they've earned the right to be among the very best. The food is definitely worth the wait.\n\nTheir menu of Sichuan classics is as vast as one will find in these parts and having tasted a better part of the menu, I'm pleased to report I've liked just about everything. One will not find any pupu platter or general tso's here, so best move along if that's your thing. For the rest of us seeking out the real thing, this is the right place.\n\nI would recommend starting with a variety of cold dishes \/ appetizers to wet the palate. This includes their classic mouth watering chicken (\u53e3\u6c34\u96de), chilled cucumbers (\u723d\u53e3\u9ec3\u74dc), spicy belt fish (\u9999\u9165\u5e36\u9b5a), and their mala beef tendon (\u9ebb\u8fa3\u725b\u7b4b). There are a number of other spicy things on their starter portion of the menu, but the aforementioned represents a good variety already.\n\nIn terms of the rest of the menu, I really enjoyed their lion head meatballs (\u7d05\u71d2\u7345\u5b50\u982d), spicy and crispy chicken (\u98a8\u5473\u8fa3\u5b50\u96de\u4e01), twice cooked pork (\u56de\u934b\u8089), with red oil wontons (\u7d05\u6cb9\u6284\u624b), dan dan noodles (\u56db\u5ddd\u64d4\u64d4\u9eb5) and their chengdu mung bean jelly (\u6210\u90fd\u5169\u5206). I would also add their fragrant ribs (\u98c4\u9999\u6392\u9aa8), any of their tilapia or better yet their poached fish filet in hot oil (\u6c34\u716e\u9b5a\u7247) or the similar but equally delicious mala fish fillet with soft tofu (\u8c46\u82b1\u9b5a\u7247). The hyper local \"ants in a tree\" (\u879e\u87fb\u4e0a\u6a39) is excellent and the crispy mala beef (\u5e72\u7178\u725b\u8089\u7d72) is not to be missed. Of course, I would also throw in the mapo tofu (\u9ebb\u5a46\u8c46\u8150), cumin beef or lamb (\u5b5c\u7136\u725b\u8089\/\u7f8a\u8089), and kung pao chicken (\u5bae\u4fdd\u96de\u4e01) just for feast's sake.\n\nThe service is quite good and extremely bilingual. The place may not win awards for decor but the white tablecloth would suggest they're more than just a casual spot for food. Prices are not cheap and there is almost always a wait. Parking is plentiful since it shares the same massive lot as Hong Kong Mall. \n\nLastly, I would say to bring a nice group here. This kind of food is perfect for family style and worth trying a variety of stuff. One should order similar flavors (mala, fried, fragrant, etc.) but change up the items for every meal just because of the variety. I am impressed with Mala Sichuan Bistro and look forward to my next meal here.","4":"I can't believe I've never written a review for Mala Sichuan before. I've been here so many times. I can easily say that this restaurant has the best value out of any Sichuan restaurant in Houston. The great food and relatively lower prices make Mala Sichuan a home-run! \n\nYou must order the spicy chicken cubes. I've tried this entree at literally every Sichuan restaurant in Houston, and Mala Sichuan easily has the best one. You just can't beat the tender crispy chicken. If you are feeling particularly adventurous, you should definitely try the tea smoked duck. Each piece is super flavorful, and they also give reasonable portions. No Sichuan meal is complete without Mapo Tofu, and Mala Sichuan definitely delivers with this dish as well. \n\nOverall, you can expect to have a great experience at Mala Sichuan. The food is some of the best in Chinatown. The only downside is the restaurant can get busy especially during the evening on the weekends. Can't wait to be back!","5":"Of all the Szechuan places I've tried in Houston, this place is the SPICIEST of them all. I came here for dinner on a Saturday with some friends; this restaurant is great for groups. The food and service were great.\n\nWe ordered the Dan Dan noodles, Sweet Wine Fish Fillet with wood ear mushroom, Red Oil Wontons, Hot and Sour Soup, and Mapo Tofu. The Dan Dan noodles were so spicy, something I didn't expect - but they were so flavorful and I enjoyed each mouth-searing bite. The Sweet Wine Fish Fillet was so good - super savory, and it complemented the spiciness of our other dishes. The Hot and Sour soup was solid, but I've had better. The Mapo Tofu and Red Oil Wontons were spicy and delicious. Once my taste buds recover from all that spice, I'll be back!","6":"1. Service - friendly waitstaff and cashiers. This place is A-La-Carte, so you wait to be seated, order at the table, and pay up front. \n\n2. Price - most dishes are less than $10, but I think some can be $15-$20. \n\n3. Ambiance - cute, cozy, and an awesome place to bring friends and family. Dress code here is casual. \n\n4. Food - if you love spicy foods, check this place out. Some dishes that resonates with me is the DAN DAN NOODLES, the CRISPY FRIED CHICKEN, MA PO TOFU, and the GARLIC BACON. \n\nForewarning, don't eat the Dan Dan Noodles by itself. Balance this dish with soymilk and something that is not spicy. It has a special pepper spice that has a huge kick. Kind of like how Wasabi is a different kind of spicy. However, it doesn't shoot up the nose, but it still kicks your butt pretty bad if you swallow a huge mouthful. Maybe I'm exaggerating? I guess you should try then! \n\n5. Cleanliness - dining area appears clean.","7":"If you're a fan of spicy food, you're a fan of Mala. The inside isn't too big, so be ready to wait when it gets busy. Keep in mind they give a slight discount if you pay in cash (which I never have on hand...)\n\nI've had the crispy basil chicken, mapo tofu, Dan dan noodles, and spicy beef chow mein. The Dan dan noodles were not really my thing, although they do seem like a very popular item. You get white rice with your meal and the overall portion is pretty solid. Hope to be back soon!","8":"Food was decent. Nothing absolutely blew me away but it was a good dinner. The cold dishes we had were probably most memorable. The stand by dishes like ma po tofu and the Kung Pao chicken were tasty but not the best I've had. The garlic bacon sounded good but wasn't super impressed. The most disappointing dish was the hot oil wontons. The skin was a bit too think for my liking and the sauce was too sweet. \n\nGreat value for the price and service was great.   The place was standard china town chic (aka a bit of a mess), but you go for the food not the ambience.","9":"Tried this place for the first time yesterday and I have to say, it was good! We ordered a bunch of stuff (though my 4 friends & myself couldn't finish it all ), but nonetheless here's what we had: \n\nRed Oil Dumplings- my favorite thing by far! \nKung Pao Chicken - pretty delicious\nSpicy & Crunchy Chicken - too many red pepper chili \"flakes\" and the chicken wasn't spicy, just really salty in my opinion\nDan Dan Noodles - it was good\nCumin Lamb - the lamb was tender, it was just too much cumin for my liking (also, we had found a tiny piece of blue rubber band in this dish after we ate some, but the server was kind enough to report it and take it off of our check)\nHouse Fried Rice - delicious!\nSalt & Pepper Fried Shrimp - the batter was pretty standard, but the shrimp size was great\nTiramisu Crepe Cake - So yummy! \n\nOverall, I did like the food, but I'm going to try different things next time I come back. The service was fine. I guess it was just super busy that we weren't always helped, but it's fine. Oh and price-wise, I'd say it's pretty worth your money.","10":"Went here with a coworker, his wife, and their pretty little new born!!! I always let him pick the restaurants because he always picks the best or his wife! They have never failed me!! \nThe portions are family sized so keep that in mind when ordering. Can't remember the names of the dishes we ordered but they were all delicious!!!! We did have a beef, chicken, and seafood dish! OMG!!!!! All were good. All meals come with rice (cooked just right) and we also ordered a soup for appetizer! Huge portion! The server we had was awesome and very attentive! We went at lunch time and it was packed! Parking is a little tricky but not a real issue. China Town never disappoints!!!","11":"Yum! Had a craving for Sichuan food and came here to satisfy it. A coworker and I got the dan dan noodles, garlic eggplant, matcha crepe cake and one of the beef items. I sadly don't remember which one. \n\nDan dan noodles- these weren't my fav dan dan noodles ever. I'm not quite sure why. They were a little more sour than I usually prefer, but they were still good and oily and tasty. \n\nGarlic eggplant- my fav item that we ordered! There was a generous amount of eggplant and it was all tender and well spiced. Soooo good. \n\nBeef - the beef was okay. The waitress mentioned that this was one of the more popular items on the menu. It was good, but tasted more like chinese take out than Sichuan food if that makes sense. It was good but tasted like mongolian beef that you could get anywhere.\n\nMatcha crepe cake- the waitress realllly suggested we get this and she was right. it was so good! The pair it with honey and it might sound weird, but it pairs SO WELL!! the crepe cake was amazing and I will definitely get this next time I come, but I will be sure to get my own slice!!\n\nGreat spot, and nice interior. Will definitely be back.","12":"Food was A-OK. Not as hot spicy as expected, which was not an unpleasant surprise. Fish was really good; chicken was a tad dry. All dishes came with a serving spoon, which was a nice accomodation for westerners unused to communially picking food up with chopsticks. \n\nExcellent service politely offered fork and knife (unnecessary for me, but again a kind offer). Really cramped tables made any escape to the washroom a tactical challenge.\n\nIn addition to crowded seating, chairs had no cushioning: NOTHING to encourage lingering after the meal, so eat and leave, or your butt will go numb. This alone subtracted a star. Also, I cannot recall any background music.","13":"TLDR: This is as authentic as it gets in regards to Chinese food in Houston. Be sure to order the spicy crispy chicken (la zi ji ding), and try whatever else looks good; it probably is. \n\nMala Sichuan is a consistently good place to get your Sichuan food fix. In my opinion, it holds the prize for most authentic cuisine, too, and I've yet to try something actually bad here. On this occasion, I was able to try a number of dishes, but on this review I'll only mention the dishes I haven't tried before or are not as popular\n\nClassics here like include mapo tofu, water boiled fish or beef, and the spicy crispy chicken (a must get, in my opinion). Don't be afraid of 3 spice peppers; that's what you came here for. I actually think some dishes could be even more spicy.\n\nThis time, I tried the spicy eggplant, cumin lamb, kungpao chicken, shrimp fried rice. Though I generally dislike eggplant, I found it to actually be especially tasty here. For a vegetarian option, I would say it is also a must order. The sauce makes the dish; it's spicy, sweet, and savory, combining with tender eggplant to perfectly complement a bowl of white rice. \n\nThe Cumin lamb was also something I would reccomend trying, given you like lamb. It has a pretty strong flavor and serves as a nice contrast to the usual meat dishes. The flavor profile of the dish is also a little different from the typical Sichuan dish, and isn't as \"ma\" (describing the numbing spiciness), providing a nice contrast. \n\nThe kung pao chicken was exceptionally good, in my opinion. Mala's execution is definitely more authentic than any other place in Houston. Personally, it isn't as spicy as I would like; the sauce errs on the sweeter side. Nevertheless, the kungpao is still great option if you're not into deep fried food or are feeling something a little less spicy.\n\nI've yet to encounter another place serving Chinese cuisine from a province other than Sichuan that can match Mala in terms of authenticity and flavor for the given price. 4 stars or better, every time. \n\nTip: cash payments are also 5% off the total bill.","14":"Delicious food and great service. The ants on a log, ribs, cold dish cucumbers with garlic, and mapo tofu \nAre fantastic!!","15":"I came here 4 times with a different set of family members and coworkers and friends all in one week. And it was absolutely great every single time. Had leftovers for days. We ordered the cumin beef (freaking amazing, ordered Everytime), spicy crispy chicken (unusually tasty), Kung Pao chicken (i wasnt a fan, but my father in law loved it and said it was the best he had), water boiling fish (soft spicy saucy fish, absolutely delicious, has a slow burn that I enjoyed very much, ordered Everytime), house special fried rice (I've had better), sauteed spinach (I bit on the oily side, but I liked it) and egg plant in spicy garlic sauce (not a fan, but definitely better than other places). All in all, this is a tie with my other favourite Chinese restaurant now. Service is always great here. The Jasmine tea has the right flavor and really helps to soothe the soul. The ambience and decor is a lot nicer than other asian establishments on bellaire. They automatically charge a 15% on parties of 4\/5? I will continue to come back here! Love this place!!","16":"Was greeted right away and sat down. Ordered 3 entrees and kid you not, food was out within 10 minutes even though the restaurant was full! Very impressed. \n\nWe got the twice cooked pork, water boiled fish, and spicy crispy chicken. They were ALL amazing. The water boiled fish wasn't disturbingly spicy. It didn't have that numbing factor most Sichuan food have which I appreciated because I felt I could actually enjoy my food. Service was good too. Our waiter checked frequently on us.\n\nIf you pay with cash, you also get a 5% discount. I would DEFINITELY come back again!","17":"Mala was exactly what I needed for a nice dinner with friends. For one, this place's wait was very minimal because they get ppl in and out quickly. Their service is fast and the food comes out hot and fresh, ready made when you order.\n\n\nHot and sour soup- great, not actually very strong and salty like other places\nThe boiling fish filet-greatest of all the dishes- get it it is a must, with Chinese cabbage at the bottom\nKung pao chicken- it's pretty good\nSpicy crispy chicken- great but not the most innovative\nCumin lamb- that was super tasty\nDan Dan noodles- great texture and nice spice level\nOverall the food was all very tasty, the only one I didn't care for was the chili oil dumplings \n\nThe menu was vast and I hope to back and try some more, the platters have a lot of food, fresh food, spicy but not too hot, and fast food and efficient and nicer service than other places in china town \n-most important this place is authentic Sichuan food, which is always delightful- some may not appreciate that- but I care about this and care not so much for anything fusion \nI don't think you should compromise taste for a more western palate \n\nThey also give a five percent discount if you pay I. Cash- we all pinched in and had a nice meal and a great deal\nHave to try this place \nWhen I review I look at everything- the portions were large for a group of four \nThe service was great\nAnd in no way is Dan Dan a main dish\nPpl need to bring their brains when they review- the amount of food doesn't really say anything about the food or if it's good or not- the food is very reasonably priced- it feeds a lot- but the most important are two things- cleanliness and tastiness- this place fulfills both- when ppl review- review about those two aspects","18":"SPICY food is LIFE!!! I love love spicy food, but for me it's very hard to find delicious spicy dish. Other restaurants claim that they have spicy food, but in reality their food taste almost sweet. \nOn the other hand, Mala... OMG, their food is so so soooooo good!!! I get so happy when I see my crispy fried chicken haha\nService is on top as well, quick and efficient!\nThank you guys for my spicy happiness","19":"Despite perhaps being the most often recommended Chinese restaurant in the city of Houston, Mala serves good but not the best Sichuan food in town, though, they should be lauded for their consistency and popularizing the cuisine that dominates the Houston Chinese food scene. The original Mala serves all the Sichuan dishes we've come to expect, and does most of them remarkably well at a price point on par with its competitors.\n\nI've been here many times, and I've tried a good range of their dishes. Their food is relatively consistent, and is certainly tasty. I always like getting the spicy and crispy chicken cubes at any Sichuan restaurant, and this place is no exception. Their water boiled beef is good here, too. Mapo tofu and eggplant are great vegetarian options. The boiled fish is a good seafood pick. Almost everything on their menu tastes good, but with so much fierce competition in town, nothing blows me away either. I was surprised to find out that this place is still packed and has a line on Friday nights these days. Personally, I like the chicken better at Pepper Twins, and the overall food experience better at Chengdu taste, but Mala still seems to be the most widely known option for the fiery Chinese cuisine that is Sichuan food, and it is a respectable choice.\n\nAs I mentioned, this place still does get crowded and seating is somewhat limited. The private rooms on the side make this a great place to have a large gathering or dinner party, so call in advance if that's what you're looking for. This original location on Bellaire has been around for a while and is still going strong, and is certainly worth a try to learn about where and how it all started. 4 stars.","20":"I kinda hesitated before making a reservation here. Our family is not pretty much a fan of spicy food, but it turned out to be a wonderful place. We got a private room for 13 people with required minimum order of $150. \n\nThe restaurant is pretty old style looking, but clean and neat. Service was friendly and great. We ordered quiet a lot of dishes to share \n1. Red oil dumplings: pretty decent 3\/5\n2. Tea smoked duck. (4\/5) Unlike Beijing duck with crispy skin and oyster sauce, the duck is well seasoned instead. Some said it's salty a bit, but I just love the way they do it here \n3. Stir garlic Bok choy and water spinach. 5\/5 healthy dishes, fresh vegetable, and not as oily as other places I been. \n4. Boiled fish 5\/5. This is one of the most fav dishes here for sure. \n5. Spicy and crispy chicken 4\/5. One of the most popular dishes too.\n6. Slow roasted tilapia.(3\/5) this is their award winning dish. I didn't get much of it or impress about it. \n7. Cumin beef (4\/5) the flavor is really strong and especially spicy. The beef is soft, well seasoned , not over cooked. \n8. Mapo tofu (3.5\/5)it is pretty decent. \n9. My fav eggplant dish. (5\/5) they cut the eggplant in big pieces so they ain't mushy at all.\n9. We also fried rice, Dan Dan tofu for our kids. \n\nI love how they have good size for big parties. I don't think they have spicy levels specifically so gotta pay attention and request to reduce the spiciness. I def come back.","21":"One of the best Sichuan food in Chinatown. There is also another location off of Westheimer, but this location is better by far. While the location on Westheimer has a more upscale design, the location in Chinatown is more homely, something I tend to gravitate to.\n\nEating family-style is a must at this restaurant. Personally I enjoyed the mapo tofu and the spicy chicken cubes, which is a dish fried with dry peppers. The spicy chicken is a fun dish to eat because it makes your tongue numb - quite literally.  If you have a friend coming into town, this restaurant will surely impress them","22":"I have been to Mala several times and I'm always happy with the food here! I can't wait for the Katy location to open. I love Sichuan food and have tried my fair share of Sichuan restaurants, but Mala is one of the best! The spice and flavor level is on point. My go to items are the mapo tofu, spicy crispy chicken, spicy eggplant, and wontons in chili oil. These dishes are delicious and not too greasy. Food comes out fast and the servers are what you would expect of at a typical Asian restaurant in Bellaire - direct, little words... you just have to know what you want, read the reviews, or wing it based on the description in the menus. The servers don't really give an in depth explanation of the dishes. Weekends get a little busy so expect a wait especially during peak times.\n\nPrice is fair and portions are average sized. Enough to share if you get a few items. \n\nIf you pay cash, you get 5% off!","23":"My ultimate FAV place to eat Sichuan food!! They have all my favorite dishes: Dan dan noodles, spicy chicken, red oil dumplings and cumin beef!! I love the tongue numbing spiciness of the Dan dan noodles and the spicy chicken is soooo tasty!! The staff is so nice and the space is clean and elegant!","24":"Sichuan food is becoming one of my favorite Asian cuisines ! I love the numbing sensation the peppers give and Mala does an amazing job of using it in their dishes. \n\nMy favorite dish is the spicy crispy chicken ! It's a must try. It has great flavor and gives your mouth a tingly feel. I love the crispyness and the chicken is never dry. \n\nI also really like the dry fried green beans. They aren't that spicy so it's a great dish to give your mouth a break from the heat. \n\nWe also got the dan dan noodles. I know it's a popular dish in Sichuan cuisine but I wasn't the biggest fan of it. The flavor wasn't for me. If you try it out, be warned.. one bite and your mouth is NUMB in the best way possible. \n\nOur waters were constantly being filled and service was friendly. If you pay cash there's a discount. I think it's 5% or 10%, I don't remember exactly. But if you don't have cash, they accept card. Everything was great, can't wait to come back !","25":"If your looking for some good spicy Mala food then this is the place! The crispy Mala chicken is really good and moderate spicy, but if you want something that is super spicy. Get the Dan-dan noodles, the noodles have a really strong kick to it. While the crispy chicken helps bring down the heat a little. Will definitely go back and try some other dishes.","26":"The food tastes great but not as spicy as I expect. Service is 5-star!\nPlenty of parking spaces in front of the store.\nA very popular restaurant, So may expect a line if coming in during the weekend.\nDessert is actually above my expectation. It tastes just like the crepe cake in Lady M.\nOverall, I'd like to recommend this restaurant for people who visit Houston and look for a Sichuan-style restaurant.","27":"The food here is so so good! My group ordered the mapo tofu, spicy n crispy chicken, fish filet w pickled peppers, and the mongolian beef! All were very delicious in its own way. I think the most unique one was the fish filet with pickled peppers. The dish was very refreshing and light compared to the other plates that were more on the saltier side. Service was super fast when I went, so no problem with that! Overall, this is a great place to eat family style if you love trying multiple dishes :)","28":"Five stars if you're not into spicy food, four stars if you are into spicy food. Their spicy level isn't as spicy as expected so people who like spicy food don't get your hopes up. I feel like their level of spicy isn't calibrated right. \n\nWe got two plates of chow mein both level 3 spicy but one of the plates wasn't spicy at all (however the other plate was the perfect level 3 spicy). Both plates of the chow mein, regardless of spicy level, was delicious. The spicy and crispy chicken (ordered level 3 spicy) also wasn't spicy (probably a level 1). The spicy and crispy chicken was a bit dry too but still good nonetheless. They put aloooot of pepper on that plate vs the chicken though. Dumplings were delicious, and the dan dan noodles was my favorite dish! A bigger bowl than I expected. \n\nThe place looked clean, and the staff was friendly. I really like how they decorated their walls with plates. Their menu prices were affordable too! Will be coming back!","29":"Best in town. Prefer the Bellaire location to the Westheimer and eagerly awaiting the Sugar Land location!\n\nMala is consistency delicious and hits the spot every time. I eat here almost weekly. Everyone I've recommended this place to loves it and goes regularly.\n\nLa = spicy. Mala = very spicy. This place packs that good heat with just the right amount of numb from the Sichuan peppers! Though not everything is spicy, it is the style of the region, so spice is to be expected.\n\nI mostly eat veg. Recommended dishes are chilling cucumbers, bamboo shoots in red chili oil, lotus root w\/ Sichuan peppers, mapo tofu, and eggplant, which is tender and delicious.\n\nWhile mostly veg, the tea smoked duck is excellent. Subtle, pleasant, and a great price! Similarly the cumin-spiced lamb!","30":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Bellaire area, and probably my favorite Chinese restaurant in Houston (to be fair I am partial to Sichuan food for sure). My entree favorites are the eggplant dish and the Mapo tofu, which are our staples. In addition to those we typically try a new dish each visit - we been here numerous times and have never had a dish we didn't like! This is my top recommendation to friends when they ask for a Chinese Food recommendation, and this is where I bring friends\/family when they visit from out of town. The restaurant itself is casual and low-key, always full of people for dinner, and clean and respectable. We really like it and look forward to returning again and again. \n\nOf note, I do think this location is better quality than the location in the loop, so we always drive the extra 10 minutes for Bellaire location.","31":"This place has such great food. Water boiled beef is something we always order. Only bad thing about this place is that you have a spicy restaurant yet only one toilet per gender XD","32":"If you have not tried this restaurant, you are totally missing out! The flavors are so interesting. I try to order something different every time and I'm never disappointed. The safest dish you could order is the crispy spicy chicken. The water boiled fish, any of hotpots, and the mala crispy beef are our favorites! We order in Mala a couple times a month. It's THAT good","33":"I came back and I loved it! My sister and I got the Northern Boiling Fish, 1\/2 a tea smoked duck, and the garlic bacon.  We also ordered tea, but sadly the kettle had cold tea. Other than that, everything was wonderful. The garlic bacon appetizer came out pretry quickly. It was thin slices of tender pork belly wrapped around thin slices of cucumber (like a pinwheel). The sauce is really flavorful, not really spicy but tastes great.\nThe northern boiling fish is a whole pot of spicy chili goodness! Flavorful with slices of fish, slick sweet potato vermicelli (the kind of noodle used in Korean japchae), tender tofu, wood ears, and veggies like cabbage. It tasted AMAZING with rice.\nTea smoked duck? Incredible. Probably the best I ever had. Crispy skin, juicy tender meat. Smoky flavor better than bacon.\nThe manager was extremely nice and honored the business owner's offer of a comp meal.","34":"Looking for a new place to try we ran across this gem.  Reading the reviews on YELP, this place sounded promising and as we scoured the menu we settled on a pork and dry tofu dish, basil eggplant and a bowl of hot and sour soup!  The waiter we had, William was very nice and helpful with a cheerful attitude which was nice!  When the food came out I was really impressed with the taste!  Not too spicy. Not too salty. With a good flavor.  My family enjoyed the experience very much!  As we were eating we saw other delectable dishes being served and William would tell me what they were. To definitely be tried in the future!  \n\nI think we found another favorite place to add to our list next time we're in the area. The place was pretty full for a Thursday night and the ambience inside is kind of charming!  \n\nAll in all a good experience and I would highly recommend it!  Give it a try!","35":"Been coming here for years. They know how to make a good, actually spicy dish! I love this place when I am craving Sichuan dishes. They are a bit more pricey compared to other restaurants close by but their spicy crispy chicken is something special I cant find any where else. Highly recommend to spice lovers.","36":"I was craving Sichuan style food and happened to be in Chinatown, sifting through my bookmarked businesses.  I opted for Mala Sichuan, based on good reviews and menu selection online.\n\nWe arrived for early lunch and the place already looked very busy.  We were seated, given menus, and the waiter took our drink orders.  As I had glanced through the menu prior to arriving at the restaurant, I kind of had an idea on what to order.  We went with a spicy fried chicken and kung pao chicken.\n\nThe Spicy chicken was absolutely delicious.  Small chunks for perfectly fried boneless chicken, accompanied with boat load of dry red chilies, green onions and cilantro.  I loved it.  Our Kung Pao was pretty good too.  Definitely looked much better and spicier than what's presented at any Americanized Chinese restaurants.  Plenty of red chili on the Kung Pao.  I wanted to try their spicy fish and the seafood soup but that'll be on the subsequent visit.\n\nService was up to par.  Our waiters were attentive, and were collectively serving all the tables.  There was no One server per table but rather all were helping each other out.  \n\nI will be back here soon.","37":"Mala Sichuan has become one of my favorite places to eat in Chinatown. I always like to come here when I'm craving a homey meal. Their family-style is ideal for groups and portions are shareable. Although it's located in a bit of a run-down plaza alongside many other Chinese restaurants. \n\nNonetheless, Mala offers authentic Sichuan cuisines. I can always count on them to deliver consistency through the quality of their food. There is an abundant of dishes to select from. Their menu is categorized from veggies, meat, soup, rice, and etc. Easy to read and descriptions of each dish is available.\n\nSome of my go-to dishes that I always have to get are the spicy crispy chicken. Small chicken cutlets with a not so overwhelming amount of spice. The chicken meat is tender and the fried-layer is crispy. Just be careful to not eat the red peppers. A favorite veggie item is the spicy eggplants. Eggplants are always cooked to perfection. The eggplants literally melts in your mouth. It goes great with a bowl of white rice provided with the meal.\n\nIf you're looking for something to start off the meal, then I would recommend the hot and sour soup. Portion was big enough to share between 3-5 people. Equal level of spicy and sour in the soup. The water-boiled fish fillet also goes great with white rice. The texture of the fish is soft and the sauce of the fish was nicely seasoned. \n\nThe dan dan noodles is also a popular item here. Watch out for the spiciness after you have mix it up. It numbs your lips and tongue. Service is always fast, food doesn't take that long to come out. This place is usually crowded at most hours, but they move fast. Friendly staff who refills your water frequently. Overall, one of the best in Chinatown.","38":"We walked in and saw two empty tables. Of course it was too good to be true as they wouldn't sit us there as a group of three. They asked if we would be willing to share a table so they waited until another pair of people walked in and proceeded to put us in the back private room\/storage area. We ordered a of food to try a variety of things, but it was awkward as the other people just shared a single fish dish sitting across from our buffet of food. Overall the food is all good, flavorful and well spiced.\n\n Fragrant ribs are worth a try, pretty unique. The hot and sour soup has good flavor but it's a little thin. Mongolian beef well flavored, and a cooling off for the other dishes. The red oil dumplings had a nice size\/sauce but could have used a but more meat to noodle ratio. Dan Dan noodles were average, but enjoyable.\n\nHad we been seated immediately and not had to share the storage closet I probably would give the place a 4.","39":"When my non-Asian friends ask for recommendations on where to go in Chinatown, Mala Sichuan is my one of my go-to places to recommend. \n\nIt is spicy, flavorful, and authentically Chinese, while offering various types of dishes to cater to the masses. \n\nIf you are going to Mala Sichuan for the first time, I would recommend bringing at least 4-6 people, so you can try a variety of dishes. Here is what I would get - all these are pretty traditional Sichuan dishes and guaranteed crowd pleasers (especially for first timers)\n\n1. Spicy Boiled Fish\n2. Eggplant in Garlic Sauce\n3. Twice Cooked Pork\n4. Mapo Tofu \n5. Black Pepper Beef\n6. Water Spinach (because you need some veggies to ensure healthy digestion)\n\nPortions are relatively generous and overall affordable, with each dish ranging from $8-$14. Other dishes I would also consider include Cumin Beef and the Kung Pao Chicken. \n\nNote that sometimes there can be a short wait for a table - because it's so delicious! I would also recommend going to the Bellaire location instead of the Montrose location because the prices are a little lower and feels more authentic in Chinatown. Menus are slightly different too. \n\nThe only downside of this restaurant is that Sichuan food is a little oily. So don't come here if you are on a diet!","40":"Well I'm disappointed. \n\nI came for red oil dumplings and they were topped with too much brown sauce and not enough red oil. The red oil dumplings were still PINK inside. I.e. Undercooked. I tried to get it fixed but there was a HUGE communication barrier. Anyways I got diarrhea after having 1\/2 of one. Thanks. \n\nGarlic cucumber and bacon dish was good. This is also topped with red oil and if you look at my pictures, you will see there's a significant difference. This dish was good. Very good. The red oil sauce makes a dish. Which is why the red oil dumplings, undercooked and under dressed, was unsatisfactory. \n\nThe eggplant dish was way too sweet. \n\nCumin beef was overseasoned. When they say cumin beef expect a whole bottle of cumin. \n\nThe spicy crispy chicken is numbing but the only consistently good dish that I've had here. \n\nHonestly, I was embarrassed that I took my sister to this restaurant.","41":"Mala is most definitely my goto restaurant for Sichuan food. Every time I go there, I always leave happy and satisfied with my meal. \n\nStarting off with their food, my recommendations are: \n\n-Mapo Tofu: Some of the best mapo tofu I have ever tried, granted I don't each Chinese food extremely often.\n-Mala Fish Fillet: Comes in a similar sauce\/oil as the mapo tofu and the fish is extremely tender!\n-Kung Pao Chicken: Really good flavor overall and my friend's favorite dish.\n-Spicy and Crispy Chicken: Definitely one of my favorite dishes. I would say it's mild spicy (avoid the peppers if you can't handle spicy well) and the chicken is very crunchy. Each bite feels like a burst of flavor.\n-Crispy Mala Beef: Thought this dish was very mediocre. Beef was crispy but wasn't too impressed with the dish overall. \n\nThe service here is A+. You can tell the servers work cohesively as a team, and they are also very attentive by constantly making sure my water was filled and that I always had enough rice. I forgot my leftovers inside the restaurant, and they ran outside and chased me down to give it to me!\n\nTips: If you pay with cash, it's a 5% discount. I also recommend going at non-peak times as it can get pretty busy.","42":"I love everything spicy, and since moving here I've been searching for a great place that offers schezuan food. Im so happy I found this place, it definitely exceeded my expectations! \n\nAtmosphere\/service: seems small when you walk in, but they have a big separate room in the back for large groups or private parties. All the tables are lined with a thick stack of disposable plastic covers (which I think is smart and easy for clean up because I can see it being very busy here). The walls are decorated with an eclectic array of plates that don't seem to have a common theme but it doesn't look odd. Service was great. My water was filled, and I had everything I needed. \n\nPrice: 4\/5 most Chinese restaurants serve their food family style, meaning you order a plate and everyone shares. I love this style of food since it allows you to try everything! So keeping that in mind, each entree will definitely be above $10. And depending on what you get (seafood is more expensive than meat), you'll pay up to $20. The prices are average here and definitely affordable. \n\nFood: 4\/5 the highlight of my post because eating here was definitely a big highlight of my day! My friends and I shared the garlic water spinach, mapo tofu, spicy pork intestines, spicy chili wontons (appetizer), and another dish whose name escapes my mind (sorry guys). The mapo tofu was very flavorful. The tofu was silky, and the sauce was perfect over my rice. It's not as spicy as it looks! The spicy chili wontons is a must get. Perfect in size to get your tastebuds ready for a great meal. The wontons are tossed in this garlic, chili oil sauce that is the perfect balance of salty and a little sweet. The pork intestines is not for everybody, but if you like tripe or intestines, definitely get. They are fried to a crisp, and pan fried with chili's and other veggies. The other dish that I don't remember was a clay pot with mushrooms, beef, other veggies, and this interesting jelly like substance. Not a big fan of the jelly, the texture was a little weiird for me but everything else about the dish was an A+\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a great place for spicy Chinese food, come here","43":"Omg so tasty.\n\nI will try all the authentic Chinese things.\n\nDandan noodles are just hot enough to burn but not enough that you can't eat them. Mapo tofu is peppery than most of the rest I have tried but I liked it. Get the green tea crepe cake. If anything it will soothe your burning mouth. It's also delicious.\n\nAnd last but not least I would return for the service alone. Very attentive especially for Chinatown.\n\nAC was also at a normal level aka on.\n\nParking is a mess in this lot so try to come at a weird time.","44":"Best Sichuan in town.  Great prices.  BYOB.  This is probably one of my favorite Chinese places in town and I've been to a lot.","45":"Mala holds a special place in my heart! It is one of my favorite restaurants in Houston and a must visit whenever I'm in town! Mala made me fall in love with Sichuan cuisine. Unfortunately in Dallas the Sichuan restaurants do not compare. Although Sichuan cuisine is usually associated with being spicy it's actually a different kind of spice than you may be expecting. The spicyness did not make me grab my water every few bites; it's more of a numbing sensation to your tongue. \n\nMy favorite go-to dishes at Mala or any Sichuan restaurant is cumin lamb and crispy spicy chicken. Mala's cumin lamb is the absolute best. It is always bursting with flavor and spices and never disappoints, pairs perfectly with rice. It is cooked perfectly, more on the drier side with a slight sear\/crisp which is what I prefer in this dish. Their crispy spicy chicken will make your tongue numb due to the peppercorn peppers so beware if you've never had Sichuan cuisine!! The chicken also is full of flavor and delicious! \n\nI have never been unhappy with any dish I've tried at Mala. Everything is just sooo full of flavor and makes my tastebuds oh so happy. Other honorable mentions include: twice cooked pork, dan dan noodles, garlic eggplant, and mapo tofu. Give Mala a try, you won't regret it!","46":"If you're suffering from MALAnutrition, and feeling MALAevolant, and you just got back from MALAga in Spain, after visiting MALAwi, MALAysia and MALAdagascar, and if you've managed to avoid MALAria, you're probably really horny, whether you're MALA or feMALA.\n\nI know that my raps are much MALAigned, and I've had MALAicious threats about them, so I decided to do a straight up review this time, with none of that MALArkey. I'm adaptable and quite MALAeable so that's good. But I'm also MALAdapted, like MALAnie Griffith in Working Girl.\n\nI just fed some MALArds, to try and ease my MALAise, my MALAcontent, my MALAncholy depression, and my headache, which feels like I'm being pounded by several MALAets. I also have a MALAnoma from tanning. Oops. It's MALAignant. Oops oops. Need so MALAnin. Fast.\n\nNot to mention the STD I caught from MALAnia Trump. Not her fault. Her husband did it all behind her extremely skinny, mail-order-bride back.\n\nI wanna toast a MarshMALAow. Who's with me. Omg you should see my gf's waterMALAons. So amazing. They send me into MALAtdown. Sort of like the stupid hypocritical media when MALA Obama smoked at college.\n\nI wish I could sing this review. I can't think of a MALAdy. What became of my infamous MALAdiousness? I need to just chill, and MALAow out. What I need is a dog. An Alaskan MALAmute. OMG THEY ARE SO CUTE I CAN'T WRITE ANYMORE. OMG. OMG. WARNING. WARNING. ERROR. MALAFUNCTION.\n\nOK now that the MALAodrama is over, time to actually write the review.\n\nWhat to get: Mapo Tofu, Dan Dan Noodle, Red Oil WonTon\/Dumpling, Eggplant w\/Garlic.\nAnd: Cash = 5% discount.\n\nNot just one of the best Chinese restaurants in Houston. Not just in Texas. But one of the very best Chinese restaurants I've ever eaten at. I have yet to try the more fancy location closer to Downtown, because why would I mess with perfection? I heard it's more expensive and I have a feeling it caters less to the Chinatown crowd, and therefore might be less authentic - but I will get around to try it one of these days.\n\nSo when you come to Mala, don't be shocked if not everyone dining is Asian. Word has gotten out, and there are more non-Asians (mixed with Asians) here than any other authentic Chinese spot in Chinatown. But the menu is totally Asian.\n\nThe tall girl whose long hair is a lighter shade, is the best server ever. So friendly and lovely and helpful with the menu! She's picked out many great dishes for us.\n\nInvented by Dan Akroyd, Dan Radcliffe and Dan Craig, \"Dan Dan Noodle\" is famous for having noodles the size of Radcliffe and Akroyd's noodles (Craigs is bigger, because he's James Bond). It has a tingling, oily set of amazing spices hiding under the noodles. Sort of like when a cat is hiding under your quilt and then attacks you with claws out as you get in? No? Nobody? Just me?\n\nThe Chongqing spicy chicken is good, and the Mapo Tofu is probably the best I've ever had anywhere. Dan Dan Noodle is very good, it's Barbie's fave, and they have a lot of other wonderful dishes here.\n\nThe Red Oil Dumplings and Red Oil Wonton here are spectacular. The Eggplant w\/Garlic Sauce is excellent, too. Sometimes they sell Roasted Plum Juice (Chinese style) - very interesting and unlike anything I've ever had.\n\nMapo Tofu is better than a Mapo Texas, or any map really. It will show you the best route to deliciousness. It's my personal fave dish on this menu. Full of deep, numbing spice that will transport you to another corner of the world. Spectacular.\n\nChongqing, if you've never had it, is a must. Small diced chicken pieces, fried to perfection with all kinds of peppers and spices, including the little \"nummies\" - peppercorn type things that will make your mouth numb. Then you can come back to my place and I'll make other things numb.\n\n7 and a half, in case you're wondering.\n\n7 and a half is how many other dishes I've tried here (what did you think I was referring to), and most were good, none were as good as the 3 I just mentioned. So go for those 3.\n\nSo if you're bored of Regia and Tacos LA BALA\nAnd like DeRulo you just need something to SWALLA\nAnd if Yao Ming is your fave Houston BALLA\nThen trust me, you should come down to MALA\n\nIf you want company, give me a HALA\nI'll take you to Nebraska and we'll stop in OGALLALLA\nWe'll share an Iced Tea and a Shrimp MARSALA\nAnd then we'll head to Houston for dinner at MALA\n\nI'll pop your Szechuan cherry if you pop my CALA\nI will call you Satan and you can call me ALLAH\nI'm so Hindu your Buddha when you do that KABBALAH\nA religious experience much like the one at MALA\n\nSo hop in the back seat of my IMPALA\nYou can eat my Eucalyptus like I'm a KOALA\nI know it's not that big, but your ex bf is SMALLA\nBesides, unlike me, he never took you down to MALA\n\nI won't tell anyone about your strange AREALA\nIf you tell me the definition of ACANTHOCEPHALA\nAnd I'll give it to you like Mexico gave it to GUATEMALA\nAnd when we're done with all the fun, I'll take you to MALA!\n\nWHAT\n\n(Sorry, I'm Mala djusted)","47":"This has became one of my favorite restaurants in Houston!!! The prices to me was affordable. The portion of the dishes is big. All the food I have ordered has been great so far. Other than the food, customer service was incredible. I would never expect it from a restaurant at the plaza. They also gives 5% discount if you pay with cash. I'm totally going back next week!!\n\nMy check came out to about $60, I had 5 dishes and one dessert. The cake was awesome!","48":"Okay. This place is the spot for some hype szechuan food. We got the spicy chicken, chef fish, dan dan noodles, and the bacon thing. My favorite was definitely the spicy chicken. The seasoning was packed with spice and I honestly loved it. I have a hard time handling spicy but this was a good spicy. I also liked the Dan dan noodles. Those also has a pretty good kick to them. The bacon wrap thing was not so good. It's actually not even bacon (which I was expecting) it's like a super thin pork belly. It definitely just tasted like pork you would put in a Vietnamese spring roll so I wasnt a big fan and it was cold. It was also really packed so thats how you know it's some BOMB food","49":"I met a friend at Mala on a Sunday morning for brunch. I was the first one to be seated at 11. It's small restaurant with some ceramic decor. I ordered chrysanthemum tea as I waited for my friend. We ordered the crispy and spicy chicken and the Mapu tofu, both of which were very good. In fact, I finished the entire plate of chicken by myself. To finish off, we had the matcha crepe cake with honey on the bottom upon recommendation of the waitress. It was refreshingly yummy! Definitely try it out. All in all, good food and great service.","50":"It seems like it's a reoccurring theme for this restaurant to demand \/ require tips. Multiple comments about this problem even when the restaurant specifically states it is against their policy to demand tips. That's completely false. My husband and I were chased outside when the guy asked for a larger tip. DEFINITELY freaked me out!!","51":"Overtime, this place has grown to be my favorite Sichuan restaurant in Houston. \n\nThe food: The mapo tofu is definitely a favorite for me. I've tried it at many other places, but none get it quite as good as here. The tofu is nice and soft, and good sized cubes. The sauce is rich and flavorful. It's also reasonably priced, actually being a bit cheaper than a lot of other Sichuan restaurants. I haven't had a vegetable dish here that I didn't like. The spinach, water-spinach, or eggplant are all go-tos for me. This is the first place I tried dandan noodles, and I haven't found another place where I enjoy the dandan noodles more. This is definitely a preference thing, because a lot of other places actually serve it similarly (probably the right way) and this place is just very different. The sauce is a bit spicier and less peanut-y. The crispy chicken and crispy beef are also very good. They are quite salty, but that's pretty typical of dishes meant to be eaten with plain rice.\n\nOther things: The restaurant is a bit cramped, and can get quite busy. This can mean long waits if you go at a bad time. The service is average, with nothing good or bad being notable. \n\nOverall: No matter how many Sichuan restaurants I try, I always come back here. It is easily my favorite right now. Also, the other location for this restaurant on Westheimer is not nearly as good. The same dishes there are much more bland, and the prices are higher.","52":"Went a bit ago. And it was delish!!!\n\nI love Sichuan.. \n\nThe hot oil. The cumin flavors.\n\nUghhhhhhh just take me!!!\n\nGot the boiled fish in hot oil. Dumplings in hot oil. Mongolian beef. Garlic sauce eggplant. Mapo tofu. \n\nMy favorite was the garlic eggplant and the boiled fish. Omgosh. What a fricken winner!. \n\nRestaurant is clean. Looks a bit newer than most. And  waitstaff is fine. \n\nBut forget all that. Let the food speak wonders. It is delicious.","53":"My favorite place in Chinatown! My family goes to mala at least once a week. There is truly something for everyone here and all of their food is amazing. Last year their head chef, Jianyun Ye, was one of two Houston finalists for the James Beard award along with the head chef from Hugos. It's THAT good. I would definitely recommend the Chinatown location over the Montrose location as it is much more affordable (bring cash! They'll give you 10% off when you pay with cash!)\n\nThe restaurant is tidy, well-decorated, and has a very casual vibe. Service is excellent and food comes out in less than 10 minutes. Even though I drink a lot of water and go through a lot of napkins as my sinuses clear (it's pretty spicy as expected!) the staff is very kind and manages to keep up with me!\n\nMy favorite thing on the menu is the eggplant. Both the basil and garlic eggplants are equally fantastic. Don't let these amazing dishes get upstaged by the water boiled meats and dan dan mien! When I order eggplant with my fam, everyone agrees it's the best dish on the table. I love the way mala prepares the eggplant. It's soft, savory, and filling and yet maintains that beautiful purple color. A lot of other places in Chinatown serve eggplant with a ton of sugar -practically like candy! Mala's is so much better. Mala is very vegetarian friendly and their cabbage and garlic bok choy are also outstanding!","54":"I had the cold rabbit and the Dan dan noodles.\nSuper amazing dishes that had my lips tingling with spice delight. The service was impeccable. I can't wait to go  \n\nUpdate 3\/24\/19 - I've been back a few times now and I think that I might have a Dan Dan noodle addiction. Mala Sichuan makes the best Dan Dan noodles in the Houston area.","55":"This place is a hidden secret in Chinatown! Everything on their menu is delicious and worth trying. Be prepared for the level of spicy that is Sichuan! \n\nThe service is a cut above all Asian restaurants. The service is fast and courteous. The staff is awesome and continually checking up on you. Drinks are constantly refilled. \n\nI recommend this place!!! It is a family favorite!!!","56":"Best food I have ever had! You can not go wrong with anything that you order! I'm serious.","57":"It's hard to find good quality, authentic Chinese food....you'll find it here. The dishes have a modern twist with a classic cultural foundation. They stay true to the flavors of the Sichuan region. All of the dishes are highly flavorful and so delicious. Definitely a spot I will come back to","58":"Came here on a friday night with a friend and took us about 45 minutes to get seated. Once seated, you'll find a ton of dishes to choose from, and it's a little overwhelming if you don't have someone to order for you. We just went with what Yelp mainly suggested and ordered the cumin beef, mapo tofu, and spicy crispy chicken. While the first two were pretty good dishes with great balance of mala, the third dish... instant showstopper.\n\nIf you can order only one dish here (though tbh I haven't tried anything else, so if you can only order one out of the three mentioned above), order the spicy crispy chicken. It's cut and cooked and seasoned in a way that each piece of chicken has the perfect balance of rendered fat that compliments the sweet juiciness of the meat piece itself. It's like eating deep fried pork belly almost. The mala balance as usual was on point and in addition to the savoriness, sweetness, and hint of saltiness to the dish... my god was this dish incredible. Prices here are very fair as the portions are quite big. My friend and I can eat a lot and we were near exploding once finished and also had to take some home. Also, ask for more rice if you need it (you'll need it).\n\nOur waiter was very attentive and if we needed anything she'd come help us right away. Restaurant and restroom were both clean and tidy. Service was fast.\n\nExcellent place with a showstopper dish. Can't wait to try the others.\n\n10\/10, would definitely come again and would definitely recommend to a friend.","59":"I came here a second time and ordered the cumin lamb and mala Sichuan fish. Both were cooked well and very tasty. However, this place has started to skimp out on food. Didn't feel full after this meal. The fish was quite smaller than I expected.","60":"Now my go-to Sichuan place in Houston. Food is consistently solid, spice level is competitive and service is fast and attentive - which is difficult to come by in chinatown. \n\nCome early or you'll be one of those parties congested around the front door. Can't go wrong here, definitely come check it out!","61":"Mala is by far one of my favorite Sichuan restaurants in the city. There is a reason why it is consistently ranked high on Houston food critic's list, consistent service, authentic flavor, and delicious food. \n\nThe Bellaire location has been around as long as I can remember. While all other Sichuan restaurants in the area have closed down or changed owners, Mala has always stayed the same. The menu has not changed much over the years, but there will always be seasonal specials. \n\nSome of my favorite dishes are: \n \u592b\u59bb\u80ba\u7247 - Couples lung slices \n \u5e72\u7178\u5927\u80a0 - Crispy and spicy pork intestines\n \u98ce\u5473\u8fa3\u5b50\u9e21\u4e01 - Spicy and crispy chicken \n \u5c0f\u6912\u725b\u8089\u4e1d - Baby pepper and shredded beef\n \u9ebb\u5a46\u8c46\u8150 - Mapo tofu\n\nThe things that Mala does extremely well are their fried\/deep fried dishes. The crispy pork intestine and chicken dishes that I always order are always crispy and packed with flavor. You can always expect their stir-fried dishes to be cooked to perfection. Although I would like them to be spicier.  However, for broiled dishes, I prefer Chengdu Taste. The sauce for their broiled beef\/fish tends to be too thick and starchy. On top of that, they're never spicy\/numbing enough for me. Overall, Mala has good flavor. Their spicy dishes provides a satisfying amount of spiciness and numbness without going overboard. For some who like a more intensified Sichuan flavor, Chengdu Taste is a better option. \n\nOn weekends, expect a wait at peak hours, but their dishes always come out unexpectedly fast. I've never waited more than 10 minutes for food. If you pay with cash, there is a 5% discount.","62":"I try and come to this restaurant at least once a month and I'm not sure what happened but we probably won't be returning. \n\nFirst they need more wait staff. The last two times I was there it took FOREVER just to get a refill of water. The food is spice so they should have a waiter\/waitress solely for refilling water glasses. I know it wasn't just me because I heard other customers complain about not getting refills also. \n\nNext I think they must have changed some of the recipes. The spicy crispy chicken tasted different. Almost less flavor I think. Also the chow mein was not that good. They used a different type of noodle and less garlic than before.\n\nMaybe they have just been having a bad couple days the last few times I've been but if they did change the recipes please go back to the original ones.","63":"There are a TON ok like 7 no lie Chinese restaurants in this strip center.   This one had a lot of great reviews so we thought we would try it.  first off the hot oil dumplings are a must- they weren't too hot either.  My friend had twice cooked beef- which was delicious but we had to pick past those little dried red chili peppers- they were a bit much.  I had a Sichuan pork dish that was fantastic too.  The place isn't much to look at but it is nice, very clean, seemed popular.  the wait staff were very nice and attentive- this a is a go back to for sure even with so many others around to try.","64":"I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken, and it wasn't my favorite. There were way too many dry red chilies in it. I could barely taste the chicken. I did like the Red Oil Dumplings. There's plenty of seating here, and the service is good.","65":"3.5 the fish is the best part of the place. I got the fish filet and tofu.the fish is fresh and the tofu is silken. It's not too numbing or too hot. The red oil dumplings and wonton are overpowered by the Hoisin sauce. I don't really know what sauce it is.  The Dan Dan noodles are average.  I would come back for the fish but I would really go crazy over anything else.","66":"pretty consistent in quality. I like their mapu tofu and chicken. this is a place I'd recommend if someone wanted to go eat authentic Chinese.","67":"Amazing.  Lots of tasty,spicy,good food. Great staff,super fast,good prices. The crispy chicken,king Pao,low mein,dumplings ...seriously exquisite. I was excited to go,first time in houston and it was totally worth it.","68":"The Best Authentic Sichuan food in Houston. My personal favorites are Cumin Lamb, Crispy fried chicken, Red oil Rabbit & Pot Boiled Fish. Service is quick & good. If you like spicy food, this is the place for you. The pricing is reasonable and the serving size is generous.\n\nThey have some issue if you need to split the checks for parties larger than 2. You will get a 5%discount if you choose to pay by cash.","69":"Tasty and fast service!\n\nAlmost everything you order here is right on the nose of what you expect it to taste like. The service is extremely fast. Food comes out after a few sips of tea, and the ambiance is bustling. We once ordered bamboo with pork and he asked us if we wanted it spicy. Spicy? I've never had it spicy before, so there we were, with spicy bamboo and pork...and it's every bit of weird as you might expect. \nAnother small gripe I have with this place, and almost every Sichuan place in Houston, is it's just not authentic. When i visited Sichuan a few years ago, I actually didn't enjoy the food that much, well, because the peppercorn numbed my tongue so that I couldn't taste anything. But here we are, in America, where we often change authentic flavors to cater towards our palette. \nI 100% enjoy the food here because it's delicious and doesn't numb your tongue too much. The restaurant is homey and the waits are long so have a friend come put their name down before you get here.","70":"One of my fav Sichuan places to eat in Houston. I prefer this location which is the original way more than the one Montrose. Every time I come here, there is always a line. But the food is so worth it! If you've never had Sichuan food, your tastebuds might catch on fire so you've been warned!\n\nFood here is meant to be shared. Some of my favorite items include spicy crispy chicken, mapo tofu, eggplants, and dan dan noodles. The spicy chicken is crispy and spicy but not enough to burn your tongue. Don't worry about leaving hungry because if anything, you will leave with leftovers! \n\nService has been pretty good for us with how quick food comes out and attentiveness. I highly recommend this place if you haven't been already!","71":"Updating to four stars!\n\nThe last visit was a lot better than my initial visit.\n\nThis time we arrived for lunch on a Sunday.  The interior is small, only sixteen tables in the dining room plus the private room.  So get here early!\n\nEvery dish we had was fairly tasty.  The red oil dumplings had a nice little heat to it!  I agree with other reviewers, that a thinner wrapper would have been tastier, but it was still good.  I was pleasantly surprised by the Ants on a stick here.  One of my dining partners thought it was too sticky, but I loved the extra bouncy glutinous texture!  Our cucumber appetizer was also the bomb!  So light, crisp, and fresh!  One of the better ones out there.\n\nService was quite attentive, a nice change!\n\nThe thermostat could have been turned down a bit, and it was quite noisy in the middle of the room.  Definitely not for intimate gatherings.  Also, that parking lot is just awful during peak times.  \n\nPrices are good though, and the food is tasty.  I will definitely return!","72":"Good spice, great flavor. Chicken was disappointing because it was 95% red peppers.\n\nGarlic eggplant was awesome and so was the mapo tofu.\n\nGreat and attentive service!","73":"Good food, even greater service. And that's saying a lot for an Asian establishment. I highly recommend the cold noodles SO GOOD. The water boiled fish and Mapo tofu dishes are also really good and literally melts in your mouth. I wasn't a huge fan of the oil dumplings, the oil taste was too overwhelming in my opinion. Their specialty spicy chicken was just ok too. I wanted it because I saw so many Yelp reviews about it but it was ok. Check this place out if you're in the Chinatown area. You won't regret it","74":"I'm not even going to pretend to be an expert on Chinese food. This restaurant was highly recommended by a guy I met on OKCupid. As with much of my dating life, the food turned out to be far superior than the man. And I'm OK with that. \n\nI decided to visit this little strip mall restaurant off of Bellaire the night before Thanksgiving. Tables were full of people enjoying all kinds of dishes. My go-to favorite is kung pao chicken and I really could not resist. Mala Sichuan's version isn't the heavy sweet sauce and sauteed celery kind of dish you typically see in Chinese restaurants. This one was fiery, savory, fragrant with spices. The dumplings were soft and delicate, the red oil no joke. Although I was alone, the main dish was served with a family style pot of sticky rice. It was clear many of the diners were repeat customers -- the wait staff was friendly, attentive and helpful. Definitely a must-go for anyone looking for a high-test Chinese experience.","75":"Service is fantastic like their food. \n\nI can here for my birthday dinner and the staff are very accommodating, friendly, attentive, and happy. (As in they really enjoy their work) \n\nMust try: Crispy Spicy Chicken, it's flavorful and the spice is not overwhelming. \n\nParking: tons of parking in the plaza shared with others.\n\nFood: consistently good every visit.","76":"Mala Sichuan is a family favourite in my household, we typically make a trip 3 to 4 times a month. With that being said Mala is mostly on top of keeping things consistent but there have been occasions where we've felt the dishes, particularly the spicy crispy chicken were not consistent. A part from that, service is okay there is much room for improvement but when the food is that good does the service really matter? \n\nOur family favourites are: the fried string beans (without pork) 3.5\/5\nCrispy spicy chicken 4\/5 \nCumin beef 4\/5 \nDevourable beef pot 4\/5","77":"I LOVE Sichuan food and have been to a million and one spots. This is easily my preferred spot in Houston. Spicy Girl and Pepper Twins have nothing on this place. The hot and sour clear noodles are one of my regular dishes and it does not disappoint. The mapo tofu could definitely be spicier but it is still good none the less. It doesn't match up to my #1 spot in Dallas, but when comparing all of the other options in Houston, this one is definitely up there for price and spice! The staff is also very good and makes sure to take care of you. It is worth the wait times.","78":"Mala has been in this JusGo shopping center in Chinatown forever. Even before JusGo was even there. Sichuan food has been up and coming (to white people) this year and I've been craving it for a while now. Mala offers a wide range of mild to spicy foods. My friend said this was her favorite place and I let her pick our dinner choices for the night. We came on a Thursday and it was busy (even the party rooms). We got the Dan Dan noodles, crispy beef, and green beans. I liked the green beans but they weren't anything special to me. If I had to compare I would say Cantonese style with ground pork and pepper is more flavorful. The crispy beef was cooked with red chili peppers and had a kick to it that was comfortable. The noodles were my favorite of the night (and in general when it comes to Sichuan food). The noodles themselves were thick and chewy and the sauce and meat were evenly distributed in the dish. Our waitress was kind and didn't rush us (we were talking quite a bit before ordering). The restaurant had an adorable wall with porcelain dishes and that's where we were seated. The only downside was the extra charge for using a credit card instead of cash.","79":"As a vegan, I been on a search for restaurant that serves vegan dishes, even though its not a vegan restaurant they do have several dishes that are vegan. Even though its not many dishes the dishes they do offer are so good they have me craving it on a weekly basis. The Mapo tofu and the shredded potatoes with rice vinegar are my favorite. \n\nFor a full review on this resturant and other vegan restaurants check out : http:\/\/www.imagineolives.com\/vegan-branch\/\n\nOr follow us on Instagram OR FB @vegantastingtx","80":"Ever since I got introduced to Mala Szechuan, I have visited this place so often, at least 4-5 times\/month. That's way too often for someone who drives from Nasa Parkway like me. \n\nHowever, the food is not very consistent lately. The previous times I visit, the amount of crispy chicken is like half of the dish, and the rest are chilis. When I buy this dish to-go, it has even less chicken. And the dishes are a bit salty as well. I was unhappy of course, but that does not stop me from eating at Mala. \n\nToday, my husband and I brought two friends who just move to Houston, and tried to introduce them to \"the best Szechuan restaurant in H-town\". They were so excited because they like spicy food and Chinese food. When we came in, we waited 30' for a table, which was ok for a Saturday night. Then 15' for the food to bring out, which was fine too. But then when all the dishes came, I can see the disappointment on their faces. Everything were so salty!!! The mapo tofu was wayyyyy too salty that nobody wanted to touch it again after first bite. Then the Mala Roasted Tilapia was too salty as well. The crispy chicken that I praised so much about is the only shining dish today, but again, it's still too salty compared to usual. The only thing that was not too salty is couple lungs dish. \n\nI was so embarrassed with my friends because they could hardly eat anything except for the couple lungs and some of the crispy chicken. One of them who had been on a no-rice\/bread diet for awhile, also had to eat rice today in order to reduce the saltiness of these dishes. I can see their suffer. But the restaurant was so crowded and the servers barely speak English so I was hesitant to ask them to bring the dish back.\n\nI am not sure if they change the cook or not, but it's sad that the food quality (&quantity) starts to go down while their popularity is surely going up. Hope they will fix this soon. But I won't introduce any more of my friends to go here in the mean time. \n\n\n**photo was taken at a different time, not today**","81":"Went to Mala one night for dinner hearing all this hype from coworkers. I was expecting Bellaire service but was surprised to have a warm welcome. This was definitely a plus for me.\n\nWe order the \"garlic bacon\" which was a huge disappointment as the yelp pictures were flooded with it. The pork belly was cold and the sauce wasn't really complimenting the dish. I commend them for trying.\n\nMy main dish was the Dan Dan noodles decent but in my personal opinion, it had way too much pepper corn after I requested none. \n\nAll in all, this review was based on this one visit and I look forward to exploring more of the menu in the near future.","82":"My favorite restaurant in Chinatown! West lake soup is a must and the house special spicy chicken (minus peppercorns) is my other favorite!\nThe service is the best on this side of town also... the servers really work hard and move with a sense of urgency. Their eyes are always watching the guest and anticipate the request before it is made. VERY GOOD!","83":"I love going back here when my tastebuds need to be spiced up. I love the spicy crispy chicken, sliced bok-choy, and water boiled fish.","84":"Love the couples lung. Love the crape cake. The plumb juice is traditional. Mala makes a Perfect place for date night.","85":"Went here on a Saturday night. It wasn't super busy when we arrived but soon it got quite busy. The service was polite and attentive. We chose to get hot tea, I believe it was jasmine tea, very good. I've had Szechuan cuisine before but this was my first time here. We ordered the salt and pepper shrimp, cumin beef, chili oil dumplings, hot and garlic pork, and mapo tofu and chillin cucumber. Everything was excellent, although the cucumber serving size was a bit small but it was still very refreshing to have as a side dish with all of the spice in the main courses. The mapo tofu was rich and spicy. The cumin beef did not disappoint, you can see large slices of dried chilis throughout the dish. I think I liked the shrimp the best-it was served on a bed of sliced cabbage and sliced jalape\u00f1os and the hot chili dumplings were amazing when hot. Although they can't split a check more than 2 ways, this is a great place to have Szechuan cuisine!","86":"This restaurant is one of my favorites to come to with my family. The food is definitely some of the best Sichuan food we have had in the area and the service is great. I came with my friends yesterday and I remember the servers being very attentive especially with refilling my drink. The atmosphere is average as it is a little crowded. \n\nIf you want to come, I would suggest coming a little earlier than when you plan to eat because the place isn't too big and it is very popular. There is often a waiting list but in my experiences the wait wasn't too long.","87":"Just had my first dinner at Mala Sichuan. The food was delicious but I won't be back due to the service. I met friends for dinner there around 6PM and after we finished eating, the server was trying to hurry us out and then at 730 asked us to leave to free up the table for people waiting to be seated.  Considering the number of great restaurants in Chinatown, no reason to go somewhere that will put you out.\n\nI also ordered dumplings as an  appetizer but was not told they would take 10-15 minutes to arrive until after our dinner came to the table before the dumplings got to us.","88":"Mala has great ambience! I went here with two of my friends after a weekend camping and the food definitely hit the spot. We ordered the hot and sour soup, spicy chicken and fried tofu. All of the dishes were great! What really sold me on this place, however, wasn't the food but the ambience. My only complaint would be that the chicken and tofu had a little too much pepper\/seasoning for my liking. But others may find that great!","89":"Mala is one of my favorite restaurants in Houston - this was the first place where I was introduced to Szechuan cuisine, and I can seriously say they have some good cooking going on here! \n\nMala isn't located in the main Don Huang Chinatown plaza, but it's not too far away from it. It has its own parking lot that it shares with the other stores and marketplace in the complex. \n\nNow, considering how many people probably love Mala Sichuan as much as I do, there will probably be a little bit of a wait during peak meal times. However, I've been able to get seated the times I've gone, so it's not an absurd wait time or anything. \n\nHere are some dishes that I highly recommend getting. If you haven't had Szechuan food before, beware - the spiciness is different than the traditional spicy we usually think of in other cuisines. This spiciness is more numbing and sinus clearing - it's addictive and delicious, but different, so be aware!\n\nMapo Tofu - spicy unctous sauce on top of soft tofu with little specks of pork yummm\nWater Spinach - fresh crunchy veggies sauteed with some garlic \nEggplants with Garlic Sauce \nCumin Lamb \nDan Dan Noodle - cold noodle dish that is spicy, so beware \n\nNow they do have a location in the Montrose area, but I've personally only been to the Chinatown one. I love coming out here with a group of friends and ordering dishes family style, so we all get a little bit of everything. While the waiters do speak English, it probably wouldn't hurt if someone in your group speaks Mandarin! \n\nTL;DR - one of my favorites in Houston. Seriously. Gotta come here for the Szechuan food.","90":"The hype is real! The parking lot can be difficult to navigate (tons of traffic fighting for the spots), but don't let that deter you! Every flavor is so unique and delectable, totally different from the Americanized Chinese restaurants. Their dan dan noodles are the best I've ever had. They run it like a well-oiled machine, so although it's always packed and busy, you have great service, get your food quickly , etc.","91":"Recommendations:\n- Water boiled fish\n- House special fried rice\n- Spicy beef tendon\n\nI'm not from Sichuan or a Sichuan food enthusiast so I can't be a critique in this genre of food but they sure were good. We were sweating like a water fall on steroid but kept going cause the food were good. So when we first came here i noticed the place were packed and that actually stayed the same the entire time. We ordered water boiled fish, crispy spicy chicken, house special fried rice, Combination fried rice, and others.\n\nMy personal favorites were the water boiled fish and the house special spicy fried rice. Boiled fish was soft and flavorful but also numbing hot. They do stuff alot of cabbage at the bottom so it looks like theres alot of fish but in truth it's mostly what you see on surface(still alot). I enjoyed the fried rice, kind of like a normal fried rice with a kick of Sichuan spice to it. It's nicely priced and delicious. Crispy spicy chicken was alright, just imagine an asian style spicy popcorn chicken that's alittle better presentation. \n\nService was alright until the very end when we tried to ask for split check. Waitress was so confused and seemed like she was having trouble understanding us. Called over another guy for help but he also seemed like he didnt know what was happening so we just said to give us a single check. \n\nCome here for the food, it's good if you like spicy.","92":"If you love spicy food this is the best place for you! I can't describe how much great is the food here. That addicting feeling inside your mouth. Unfortunately, I live an hour away but I still go on my days off and always place a food to go afterwards. Service is excellent and the decor is refreshing.","93":"GREAT customer service. Staff are very attentive, quick to take orders and orders came out in reasonable time. Food is flavorful - we ordered crab & asparagus soup, steamed tilapia, customized fried rice. We arrived just around opening (11am) but by the time we left, there was already a line waiting for their turn -- considering there are lots of Asian restaurants in the area, the fact that people wait for their turn in this restaurant is an indication of the many good things about this place.","94":"really loved the food here, truly authentic with the spicy and numbness! you won't go wrong with any dishes here. All their appetizers are pretty good, we especially enjoyed the spicy kidney one and the sour and spicy tofu flower one.\n\nthe service is good too, we came on a sunday afternoon around 2pm which is not in the peak hour, and the restaurant is quite full, but the waitress are very responsive to our orders and brought everything out in a timely fashion","95":"A nice restaurant different and standing out from other restaurants around the area. The food is excellent for spice lovers. The dishes are tasty and not too oily like other Sichuan restaurants. My favorite is spicy and crispy chicken. They also serve  beer and wine that go very well with spicy and crispy chicken\/pork intestine. The prices are around $10 and above but well worth it.","96":"Maybe the best Chinese restaurant in Houston and definitely better than the Westheimer location.\n\nThe portions are bigger and the prices are cheaper to compete with rest of Chinatown. Mala has more vegetarian options here also and the menu seems fuller overall although there are items that are not available here like the aromatic chicken.\n\nThe venue is smaller so there is much more of a wait and it is decorated traditionally. The food is amazing and despite the name, not every dish is a competition between the spicy chile and the numbing peppercorns. The basil eggplant was traditionally sweet and rich and the ong choy was nice and garlicky. The lotus root was crunchy and retained its crunch as day old leftovers.","97":"Dan dan noodles : overrated.\nIt was rather unflavorful and boring, imho... Instead, get the cabbage which, despite sounding lame, had the most flavor ( and I'm not talking spice flavor). \nI loved the flavors and spices and I can tell they use fresh spices because they are powerful and fragrant. \nWhen the server said, \"no, no we do Not have sriracha\" I knew it was a special restaurant. Lol. But they do have their own chili sauce which is even better. However, you probably don't need it because sichuan cuisine is spicy enough as it is!","98":"Came by around 2pm on a Friday afternoon for a late lunch for two. There were tons of tables as we came in during slow period. \n\nFOOD:\n- CUMIN BEEF ($12.95): after a few bites, this was spicy for me. It was still pretty good. I would say it's on the hot spicy level. The beef is cooked with hot chili oil.\n- BASIL CRISPY CHICKEN ($9.95): my favorite dish. Crispy chicken bites that have more meat than breading. You really can't stop eating it. I would say this dish is on the mild to medium spicy level. Just a little kick in each bite. \n\nWe also ordered Jasmine hot tea for $1.95. I believe it's unlimited refills as well. Service was great - staff was very attentive and checked up on us very often. \n\nOverall, would love to return again to try all of the other items on their menu.\n\nTIP:\n+ If you pay cash, you will get a 5% discount from your bill.","99":"Great service and food!  It was our first time dining here.  They offer extremely fast service.  We tried the water spinach, crispy mala beef, and three pepper beaten duck.  Everything thing was so good! My fave was the duck! We went at around 8:30 or 9 pm on a Saturday evening.  It was not too crowded and we didn't have to wait for a table.","100":"This place is a good staple for a good \"quickly served\" hot meal. The food comes out hot from their kitchen as soon as it has been prepared.\n\nTonight we requested less salt in the fried rice since last time we were here it was too salty!\n\nTonight we ordered basil crispy chicken, green beans, and combination fried rice with chicken. The basil crispy chicken was good, but a little too salty for my taste. The fried rice was perfect (because it wasn't too salty) and it had lots of egg in it which I really enjoy!\n\nService is friendly and requests are happily accommodated. \n\nHL & I will return soon!","101":"In this week's episode of \"The Quest for the Best Dan Dan Noodles,\" I found myself in Chinatown eating at the only Chinese restaurant to make the Houston Eater 38 list - Mala Sichuan Bistro.  Going up against stiff competition from the Dan Dan noodles at Strings and Xiong's, I was eager to see how Mala's version stacked up - and to my great delight, they might be the best ones yet!\n\nMala Sichuan Bistro serves up authentic Chinese Sichuan cuisine, so expect plenty of heat and that classic mala spice.  Most of their dishes are served family style (large plates that are meant to be shared with the table) so it helps to bring a friend or two along to enjoy the meal with you.  Today for lunch, my friend and I split a plate of their Spicy Eggplant and Mapo Tofu and loved both!  The Spicy Eggplant was on point - perfectly cooked, swimming in a nice sauce that was a little on the sweet side but still packing some heat.  The Mapo Tofu was EXCELLENT - one of the best I've had anywhere.  It had a TON of mala flavor and spice and had my tongue numb in a minute flat.\n\nBut the star of the meal (and the real reason I came here) was the Dan Dan noodles.  My friend and I both got our own bowls and WOW.  Both of us were extremely impressed - perfectly cooked noodles (on the thicker side compared to other noodle shops in Chinatown), a nice amount of pork and vegetables, and plenty of mala flavor and heat to bring on the sweats.  This is probably the best (and spiciest!) version of dandanmian I've had in Houston yet.  Despite all the numbness from the mala oil, the noodles were still extremely flavorful after getting coated in that amazing oil sauce.  Definitely a 5\/5, and if you come here and are a noodle fanatic like me, GET THESE (and grab a bowl for yourself - no sharing!!)\n\nSplit between two people, we each paid about $20 (after the tip!) for a TON of high quality and delicious food that left us in a happy food coma.  Cheap prices, flavorful dishes, and fast service - what more can you ask for?\n\nOVERALL: 5\/5.  Mala Sichuan Bistro not only boasts superb Dan Dan noodles, but some of the best and most authentic Sichuan flavors at any restaurant I've tried in the US.  They definitely deserve their spot on the Eater 38 list and I will most definitely be back to eat here again!","102":"Good food, great service and super cheap! We ordered the cumin beef, crispy chicken, Dandan noodles and green beans and our total was $41.  The food was spicy but not too spicy and the food came out quickly.  I'll defiantly go back and try some other dishes!","103":"I've been here plenty of times and everytime I go, I always have a pleasant time!\n\nFirst off Sichuan peppercorn here will numb your mouth and it's overall delicious! (you have been warned).\n\nThe things I always order is the crispy spicy chicken, water-boiled fish, eggplant and mappo tofu.\n\nCrispy spicy chicken - amazing! I will always order this when I come here. They put a lot fried chicken pieces along with pieces of pepper.\nWater-boiled fish - delicious - very oily but the fish is really flaky and I love the cabbage that comes along with it.\nMappo tofu - classic staple. I enjoy eating it with rice and it's a good contrast in texture when I switch it up between the crispy chicken and this. \nEggplant - delicious!! Super savory and sweet and probably my favorite place to get the eggplant.\n\nBecause of the oiliness of some of the dishes - drinking hot tea is always a great option with this stuff.\nHighly recommend this place to my friends","104":"Hi there. This is a great spot for some authentic sichuan food! Lets just say... the spicy crispy chicken and the eggplant was on point. The spicy chicken was like those chicken poppers double the yumminess. The eggplant was savory and thoroughly enjoyable. Both were slightly spicy, but more of the numbing kind of spicy. The portion size was perfect for two people. Service was relatively quick and the overall experience was pleasant. \n\nDo note that this place charges 10% or so extra if you're not paying with cash! Other than this, I def recommend yall to check it out if ya cravin some sichuan cuisine :3","105":"I have been here several times and am always amazed by the food. Fresh and an amazing amount of flavors.\n\nThe cilantro beef, crispy crunchy chicken, chicken fried rice, dumplings and spicy boiling fish are all amazing. \n\nThere is literally no way to go wrong with the menu here.\n\nThe price is very fare and it's all family style. \n\nThe one thing that is a let down is parking is horrid. The area is located in China Town and in a strip parking lot. \n\nThe staff is also a bit hit or miss. A few times they asked for us to sit with some random family I've never met. Especially when the table is a \"lazy Suzan\" and you get to grab your tray every other spin.\n\nThis place is definitely great food at a great price. Definitely recommend going. Go early and not hungry because of parking. Overall great!!","106":"Foods were really good. We made a reservation so we did not have any problem with waiting. Every food came out really fast. Seevice was really good as well. only hiccup is parking. Try to carpool.","107":"Had the crispy Sichuan chicken with lots of chili peppers, dan dan noodles, kidneys in red oil, and and three pepper duck. Overall everything was really tasty. The only bad thing is they're so popular there can be a line for a table. Luckily it was just my husband and I so they sat us in a tiny 2 person table against the wall.","108":"I am a big fan of this restaurant and have been frequenting it for many years. The food is authentic tasting, flavorful, and very good. My only complaint would be that they need to be more consistent in the quality and taste. At one point, we went to this restaurant 2-3 times a week. When they are busy, sometimes the food is too sweet\/stale\/salty or just warm and not hot temperature. I have noticed when they are not busy, the food taste more consistent. The Spicy and Crispy Chicken (their signature dish) will be deep friend and crunchy with lots of \"ma\" sichuan peppercorn taste, and the temperature of the food will be hot. When they are busy, this dish is often served too sweet, lacking in spices, and a little stale. I hope they work on their consistency because I do love their food.","109":"Solid Sichuan food. No complaints about this place. A group of 7 of us came for lunch and even though it was busy it didn't take us that long to be seated. But I can see seating being an issue if you do come with a big group. It's a little tight but you'll live. Food came out fairly quick considering how busy it was. \n\nWe decided to be adventurous and try the live tilapia dishes on the menu. We got the sweet and sour and the mala pot roasted tilapia I believe. It was on the pricier side and I wouldn't really say it was worth the price. It spices and the sauces on the tilapia wasn't overwhelming while still being able to taste the fresh fish taste in the tilapia. Don't expect a lot of meat on the fish. \n\nMapo tofu was solid. Thick sauce and just the right amount of spicy. Best bang for the buck dish. One of the cold dishes we got was the garlic bacon. It comes drowned in chili oil but it was just alright. I can't really say how authentic this place is since I'm not from Sichuan but I do get an authentic vibe from the dishes.","110":"Even in the midst of fierce culinary competition in Chinatown, Mala Sichuan still emerges as one of the premier choices for serving authentic, delicious Chinese food with top-notch service at a reasonable prices. If you are looking for a meal to spice up your tongue, then aim for Mala Sichuan!\n\nOne of Houston Chinatown's classic establishments, Mala Sichuan is a popular choice that stood well against the test of time and competition even as nearby restaurants have shuttered and replaced by new establishments. The reason is simple: Mala Sichuan is one of the best Sichuan-style restaurants in Houston! While staying faithful in creating the numbing spiciness that is characteristic of Sichuan cuisine, Mala Sichuan dishes are special because their flavors are not monotonously spicy or salty. Instead of overwhelming your tongue with overpowering flavorings, the flavors from Mala Sichuan please your taste bud with a strong spiciness that is yet well-balanced with other flavors in a delightful harmony.\n\nTake the red-oil rabbit appetizer as an example. In this simple-looking dish, the red oil brings a spicy flavor augmented with herbs. Added with the nutty taste from the roasted peanuts, the small appetizer dish offers a big range of flavors that somehow complement one another! The classic water-boiled fish is no different either: unlike the ones in inferior restaurants that are doused with salt and grease, this dish from Mala Sichuan brings out of the best of roasted Sichuan peppercorn by imbuing the tender fish filet with a numbing yet aromatic spiciness. \n\nAs great as its food, the service in Mala Sichuan is also impeccable. Years ago, my first experience here was met with rude servers. After being pressured by my friend to return here years later, I was shocked to see the much improved serving standards. Even without considering Chinatown's low service standards, the servers in Mala Sichuan are one of the most courteous and attentive I have experienced! Everyone was incredibly professional and attentive towards us, and this was such a far cry from Mala Sichuan of 2014 and many Chinatown restaurants today. \n\nExtraordinarily delicious food served by excellent waiting staff at a reasonable price of about $12 per dish on average: I say this is about as perfect as one can find in a restaurant! Unless you dislike spicy Chinese food, I highly recommend challenging your taste buds at least once in Mala Sichuan.\n\n---\ntl;dr version:\n1) Classic and popular Chinatown establishment\n2) Delicious dishes with terrific blends of flavors\n3) Impeccable service that especially shines in Chinatown\n4) Highly recommended","111":"I heard this place was pretty popular, so I had to try it. My friends and I ordered the garlic bacon, crispy spicy chicken, mapo tofu, and water boiled fish. \n\nI definitely like the garlic bacon and water-boiled fish. I would order that again. The crispy spicy chicken wasn't so bad, while the mapo tofu was okay. \n\nHot tea compliments with these dishes, so I would recommend to order it. \n\nThe place was clean and the service was very fast. It's not a bad place to get a meal with your family or friends!","112":"This time visiting home in Houston, the family decided to branch out and try something different.  Mala Sichuan Bistro is one such restaurant that my parents frequently pass by but never considered.  We gave it a try and ended up being rewarded.\n\nDining on a weekday night, the place wasn't packed.  We ordered a good variety of dishes, and all of them were pretty solid.  The Water Spinach was light while being flavorful.  Also loving the amount of garlic slices it came with!  The Cumin Lamb and the Whole Fish was pretty tender.  The Twice Cooked Pork was good but was expecting more fat on the slices of pork.  The duck was also tender with super crispy skin.  The meat was a bit more gamey than those I've had in other places and depending on your taste, that could be a good or bad thing.\n\nAlthough none of the dishes we ordered blew us away, we were pretty happy with the overall flavors.  The quantity was a bit smaller than we expected, and the four of us almost cleaned off all five dishes, which was an accomplishment.  Would definitely come back though!","113":"Make no mistake potential new patrons -- this location is many notches below its Montrose counterpart. The food is a whole lot less flavorful and somehow the menu\/recipes look entirely different too for some strange reason. The Mala Fish my wife and I ordered did not even hold a candle to the Dry Pot Fish Fillet we enjoy at the other location. In fact, our fish was surrounded by such an overload of bland tofu that it seemed like we were eating a modified version of Ma Po Tofu instead. We came with a fail-safe by also ordering the Water Boiled Fish fillet, which is a popular staple on the menus of both locations. Yet, this backfired too as this variation of the Water Boiled Fish fillet lacked any spice or flavor, thus not even closely resembling its counterpart at the Westheimer location. Literally nothing could salvage flavor for us in this meal and the signature Sichuan Peppercorns that are usually reminiscent with this restaurant went missing altogether. Ambience is also a whole lot worse than the other location while prices aren't lower. On the whole, it's hard to justify a higher rating, or even considering going here while the far superior Montrose location exists to serve you.","114":"Been here multiple times with friends and family! We typically order the crispy spice chicken, hot mala tilapia (beware, this is a whole fish!), crab and asparagus soup, Mongolian beef, cumin beef, green beans, and vegetable chow mein noodles. All of these are so delicious, and if you ask for it spicy, they'll bring the heat!\n\nDepending on the time, this place can be empty or packed with a long wait. They only take reservations if you plan to spend more than $50. \n\nThe service leaves a little to be desired...if you ask for something, they forget to bring it unless you remind them a few times. The one time we made reservations, they didn't seat us until 10 minutes after our reservation time.","115":"I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken but upon further review of the menu, I wish I was a little more gluttonous! I ordered by phone for a quick lunch pick up and my food was ready in the short 10 minute car ride it took me to get to their door. The place was packed for 12pm on a weekday and people were waiting to be seated. I was greeted immediately and given pretty much everything I needed with my order. The Kung Pao Chicken comes with white rice and it is SPICY. Mainly because there are A LOT of sliced peppers throughout the chicken. The flavor is good but that spice adds a little extra something. Can't wait to try other recommendations!","116":"If you like to look at plates on a wall then I have news for you!  Mala is your type of retaurante, they have many many plates on the wall!\n\nThe food is really good as well.  This my sound gross butt ;) the fried pig anus is off the chain.  I mean I wish I could have a bowl of it on a Sunday while I watch Football and eat it like popcorn.\n\nThere services is great and everything is very clean!","117":"Hands down the best Sichuan I've had. The vibe here is always frenetic and fun, the best of Bellaire.","118":"This is a hidden place east of bellaire st, I had the cumin beef, with the Dan Dan noodles and another chicken dish. The food was excellent. The place a bit old but quality is excellent, they use a lot of Chilli pepper in food which brings out the flavor,the only issue was the service was  slow trying to get the waitress attention was a bit hard but again it was a Saturday night","119":"The food is good but they are not able to accommodate groups over 4 easily. We waited over an hour for a table for 6 because the gentleman insisted that we sit at the one large round table instead of any combo of tables next to each other. They kept saying just a little longer, clearly not the truth but after an hour we decided we were committed. The food is definitely not worth the wait though...","120":"Came in as a group of 3 after seeing such excellent reviews. They wanted to seat us at a table that was kind of in the middle of the way and when we asked to change the table the hostess laughed and spoke to someone at the front in chinese and then told us that the table is fine. We looked around and saw another small table and asked if we could sit there and that's where we were seated. We ordered fried rice (mild and spicy), kung pao chicken, spicy crispy chicken, and the house special noodles. The food came within 10 minutes and looked very appetizing. The taste, however, was a completely different story. The fried rice was just that...rice. It had none of the flavor of the char that fried rice is supposed to have, no seasoning or flavor at all. The kung pao chicken tasted only of soy sauce and szechuan peppercorns- no garlic, ginger, no balance in the flavors at all. The house special noodles tasted of purely sesame oil. That's it. The spicy crispy chicken was also just that. Spicy and crispy and salty. Again, no flavor of garlic at all unless you pick up a piece of garlic. This was literally the worst Chinese food we've ever had. The worst part of this entire experience, however, was after we paid and left the restaurant the waiter followed us to the car to let my friend know she hadn't added a tip...he literally followed us to the car. The only good thing to mention was that we had ordered an extra order of kung pao and after tasting it we asked if we could cancel that order even though it was ready and the waiter made it happen. Definitely won't come back and will not recommend at all.","121":"This play was good and totally met my expectations. (I have lived in Asia for 6 years in a precious life time). Everything was prepared and made really well. I like how all the food is not too oily compared to many of the other restaurants in the Chinatown\/Sharpstown area. It's important to do the simple dishes well (I.e. the spinach) and they certainly did. The fish was also tasty, but I thought it could have more meat and a little less dry. I expected something a tad different for the dumplings but they were still satisfying! I would go back-- maybe I'll try the Montrose location next time.","122":"Fast service and great tasting food! We liked the stir fry baby bokchoy in garlic sauce, crispy chicken with basil leaves and potstickers in garlic sauce. The waitress was curt and initially we were surprised but soon realized that because they have heavy traffic, they have to speed up things. Would we be back? Maybe! There are many restaurants for Szechuan food. I like Twin Peppers better.","123":"Came to this place based off their reviews and was happy with the choice. The ma po tofu was really good although not very spicy.  The boiled fish filet was also solid although I did ask for it to be just a little spicy. I saw it had three peppers next to the name and was concerned it may have been a little too much for me.  Finally, the kung pao chicken was good but not great.  It's a dish I would eat again if it was on the table but I'd rather try something else first. Another thing I observed was how quick they brought out the food.  It felt like 5 minutes from ordering and the dishes were brought out.  Will definitely be coming back.","124":"It has been awhile since I been here but it did not disappoint! Service was great and our water kept being refilled which is rare in Chinatown. We ordered basil eggplants, water boiled beef, dan dan noodles, the spicy wontons, and crispy chicken. Everything was delicious and this place is worth trying if you never been here before!","125":"I had heard about Dan Dan noodles, and so my boyfriend and I decided to do some research and found Mala! We saw all the great reviews and were excited to try this place out. We went around 3pm and there was plenty only a few other parties in the restaurant, so we were seated right away (we were able to choose where we wanted to sit.) The server took our drink order right away, and we went to looking over the menu. The menu was pretty long, but we were able to find the items we were searching for: dan dan noodles, kung pao chicken (we ordered it without peanuts since I'm allergic) and red oil dumplings. The kung pao chicken came out first. It came with a big container of rice, and the kung pao itself was a mixture of dried chili peppers, garlic, the chicken and green onion; it was really good! It had a slightly fried taste, and I would have liked for it to have been spicier, but I really enjoyed it. Next came the dumplings and the noodles. Both of course have oil that you mix the food in and both include pork. To be honest, I didn't really like the pork that the dumplings were stuffed with, but I loved everything else about the dumplings. The sauce that the dumplings were in was slightly sweet and had hint of a smoky spice. As for the noodles, you get a good sized bowl of noodles mixed with ground pork, some vegetable, and the spicy oil sauce. The noodles get spicier the more you eat them, which I really enjoyed. Besides the food, the service was also attentive and were on top of refills. When we were ready to pay, the waitress asked us if we wanted to pay cash or card. We chose to pay cash since you get 5% off, which is awesome! Overall, I enjoyed the whole experience and look forward to coming back.","126":"About my visit on September 13, 2017:\n\nFOOD: I ordered the Couples Lung Slices, Crab Meat and Asparagus Soup, Dan Dan Noodles, and Tea Smoked Duck. I came in knowing that Sichuan food was super spicy, but I was still not prepared. It is not my kind of flavor. I am not knocking the restaurant for that just because I don't like spicy food. The soup was a saving grace for me as I could not handle the spiciness. I could see how people who love spicy food would love the flavor as it has an exotic feel to the spice. The spiciness in the couples lung slices and noodles were from chili oil that you typically could find at a dim sum restaurant. I liked the tea smoked duck but it tasted exactly like a turkey leg you could get a the carnival. It was overwhelming after a few pieces. \n \nATMOSPHERE: The restaurant appeared to be clean. I was there at a later time (after 8PM), but the restaurant was still bustling. I liked the cute plate decor on the wall. \n\nSERVICE: My water was empty for some time and it appeared that most of the waitstaff was around the back area. I don't feel that there was much service to this restaurant.\nI was able to pay in cash for a 5% discount.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Overall, I don't think I will return to this place because it was too spicy for me, but if you're into spicy food, I do think this is a decent place to stop by and try as their flavor is unique. I can't say I know of too many Sichuan restaurants in the same area.","127":"My\nBuddy and I came to this hole in the wall and omg . This is a hidden gem. Everything about this place gets a 5 star rating. Never had I tasted such great food! They use some kind of spice in their food that tingles at the tip of your tongue. Move over chef Ramsey , don't mess with these guys!","128":"This is a review long overdue! I have been to this establishment so many times and have enjoyed the food each time. Mala is one of my favorite restaurants. The location is hidden so please be cognizant while searching for it. My favorites here the green beans, twice-cooked pork, crispy chicken. Service is quickly and efficient.","129":"I picked this spot because it was new and we love spicy and wanted to try it out. I picked the spicy crispy chicken dish and it was really good. The dumplings with sauce on them .. tasty! But the Dan Dan Noodles were different! The sauce they have it in numbs your tongue.. I wish we would have gotten a warning because after a couple of bites we could not eat anymore. The noodles itself were really good but tis the sauce thats numbing. I think its an acquired taste .. A lady came up after and I asked her about the noodles she said we can ask them to put less so it wont be so numbing which I wish the guy waiter would have told us but it was cool to try! She asked if we wanted a new order but we said no.. we aren't like that! We will try again","130":"Have ate here quite a few time and all the times I come I like the service and the food . My favorite dessert from here are the crep\u00e9 cakes they are delicious will keep coming to this place","131":"Good food everytime I come. Come here if you want to try good authentic Kung Pao Chicken and not the low tier stuff at Panda Express.\n\nThis place is not for people who dont like spice. Lip numbing peppers make everything taste good.","132":"Thinking twice about returning. We've eaten here once or twice a month for the last year. On our last visit for lunch (2\/6\/18) we had a very disappointing meal. The dan-dan noodles had an unusually large amount of Sichuan peppercorns and virtually no meat. Just oil and peppercorns. The Chengdu Mung bean jelly was better as was the Spicy and Crispy Chicken but still overloaded a bit with peppercorns. We have come to expect good food here, but will stay away for a while and hope for some changes in the kitchen.","133":"Mala is one of the best restaurants for Szechuan food in Houston. Their dishes can be really oily and drowning in Szechuan peppers and peppercorns. But that doesn't mean the dish is overly spicy. I have yet to try a dish that is so spicy my nose starts dripping and sweat starts to bead on my forehead. It's a different kind of heat with these peppers that you may need to get used to before you enjoy it.\n\nI love the red chili dumplings and the spicy crunchy chicken. The water boiled fish, dan dan noodles, and their veggie plates are also very good. I've never had anything here, no matter how weird the dish sounds, that wasn't good.\n\nThey give a 5% discount if you pay with cash. The restaurant can get busy quickly as it is a popular Chinatown spot. The tables are also pretty close to each other so babies in strollers may not be great just for the lack of real estate inside.","134":"My husband says 3, I veer towards 4 stars. We both loved the dan dan noodles and would get again. We also had lamb chops and the crispy chicken. Would come back to try something new (and get more dan dan noodles!)","135":"I was here for lunch today and I would say its a great place for good food. We ordered kung pao chicken and fried rice . The quantity was just perfect and the service was quick . Definitely worth a try ..","136":"Pretty clean and nice atmosphere. Decent service - what you'd expect from Chinatown anyway. This place serves primarily Northern style Chinese food. The flavors are definitely strong, which is what I like. However, not always a fan of their numbing spice, copious amounts of oil, and saltiness of their dishes. Overall, though, I did enjoy their food. Here's a breakdown of their dishes from best to worst:\n\nTea smoked duck: 5\/5. As the name implies, it's duck smoked in tea, which really comes through. The aromatic tea flavor complements, but does not overwhelm the taste of the duck. It was my favorite dish of the night. The least saltiest dish as well. \n\nStir fried cumin beef: 4\/5. Love this dish. Fragrant and good amount of cumin spice to offset the gaminess of the beef. At first, I could've sworn this was lamb. But, I guess they serve gamey beef. The only thing I thought they could tone down on was the salt content in this dish. I had to eat a whole bunch of rice to balance the saltiness of the dish. \n\nBoiled fish: 3\/5. Not bad. Lots of oil. But, it was still tasty. The fish was also not the freshest in the world. This dish definitely leaves a numbing taste in your mouth. If you like that sort of thing, you'll like this dish. Otherwise, it's a +\/- for me on ordering this again the next time.\n\nCucumber wrapped with pork: 3\/5. Pretty good. It's served cold as an appetizer. Try it.\n\nFried pork with basil and fried beltfish:  2\/5. The pork was overcooked and way too dry. The beltfish was extremely salty. I would not recommend either of these dishes. \n\nNext time, I will to try their Dan Dan noodles, pan fried whole fish, and twice cooked pork. But, I would definitely recommend coming here to try the food for yourself.","137":"Even though some others may not be as huge of a fan, I'm hooked on this place. I order the same things every time and I love it haha. The space itself is a little cramped and due to its success, I do believe it will continue to build locations or even relocate eventually. \n\nI order the water boiled fish fillet (spicy ish, although not to me), crispy chicken (the spicy one is pretty good as well), chillin cucumber sticks (garlic goodness!), and water spinach. Those are my top 4, but I have tried and enjoyed the red oil dumplings as well! The last time, we ordered a pork with such garlic sauce and it tasted really good as well. If you're eating a lot of spicy dishes, the cucumber sticks help out a bit.\n\nThe service is surprisingly very good for an Asian place, and they're pretty welcoming\/attentive. This is one of my favorite places to eat at, and the only Szechuan place I eat at haha. I'm sure they have plenty of other delicious dishes but it's so hard to stray away from what I always order. However, I am looking forward to trying their Dan Dan noodles!","138":"quality and quantity have both declined so much! Cucumber shreds were literally less than 10, come on it's veggie!","139":"I've had plenty of good experiences at Mala in Chinatown and we've done a number of special events here. However I was incredibly disappointed by the service lately when I made a reservation for their private room a week in advance for a surprise birthday party that I was planning. Two days after I made the reservation, I saw that I had missed a call from them, but no message was left. Then when I went to confirm the reservation the day before, they told me they didn't have it as a party of 20 had booked both rooms. \n\nClearly they had my reservation since they tried calling me back after I had originally made it. Was super disappointing that they didn't even leave me a message saying they bump my reservation and that I could have showed up the next day with no reservation with 12 people. This will definitely cause me to look elsewhere for a solid dinner location with a large group.","140":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Houston! The food is always delicious and quickly but perfectly made. The service is good, as I've been here on both slow and packed days. \n\nMy go-to dishes are the spicy house fried rice, crispy mala beef, and Ma po tofu. If you are not satisfied with the amount of spiciness\/saltiness\/etc, they will remake anything for you in an instant (and this doesn't happen often). \n\nThis is definitely authentic Sichuan food (and I've been to this province in China!), so come on by to the bistro!","141":"One of the best Sichuan places in Houston. This taste is definitely and acquired one since I started liking it more after 2-3 attempts. \nWe had gone for dinner and ordered water boiled fish fillet, spicy and crispy chicken and pork in garlic sauce along with the sticky rice. \nMy favorite would be the spicy and crispy chicken with a strong peppery\/spicy flavoring served hot. The gravy fish is another item which is perfect for the rice. The pork was very soft and melted in mouth with a nice garlic flavor. \nIt might take a few trips for the taste buds to get used to it but it is well worth it!","142":"It's a good size restaurant, staffs are nice and friendly. \n\nFood:\nDumpling (2.5\/5) - For some reason the meat taste funny. I was surprised that it tasted sweet and the only thing I liked was it soft.\nDan Dan Noodles (4\/5)\nBoiled fish (3\/5) \nCrispy chicken (3\/5)\n\nOverall, the food was okay. It didn't blow me away like I thought it would be. I prefer Szechaun House over all because the food taste better, spicy, and well presented.","143":"I've been wanting to try this restaurant since I got introduced to Szechuan food. Came to dinner on a Thursday and there was plenty of table available.  \n\nFood: \n\nEggplant in garlic-- this is my husband's favorite. It's very fresh and cook perfectly. Wasn't all mushy. I typically don't care for eggplant but i enjoy eating these. \n\nRed oil dumplings-weird concept for me, not as spicy as i would thought. Doesn't have a lot of favor on the actual dumpling so make sure you soak them in the sauce it comes with before eating. \n\nWater boiled fish fillet- probably my favorite dish of all the things we ordered. Don't get intimidated by the red power sauce on top. It's not that spicy. The dish is a bit heavy than I would like. probably could do it with a bit less oil. \n\nSpicy crispy chicken- i couldn't tell if i was eating chicken or bacon :) that's how crispy the chicken was. Watch out for the pepper on the side. those babies can numb your tongue.\n\nOverall, decent Szechuan food without the wait, but i still would prefer cooking girl over this place. Maybe I'll give it another try before ruling it out all together.","144":"I had no idea that szechuan food was so different from typical Chinese food! While its' dishes (especially the Kung Pao Chicken) are full of peppers, you don't get the heat that's associated with these red peppers. The peppercorns in the dish leave a numbing effect on the tongue. \n\nI would skip on the red oil dumplings as flavor was lacking so it was akin to eating an oily dumpling. The ma po dofu was just \"meh\" -- the aftertaste was numbing and the dish itself oily. I'm a sucker for Kung Pao Chicken and would definitely recommend this dish for anyone that's familiar to Chinese food but unfamiliar with the Szechuan style. \nWait is long at this location, btw.","145":"Visited this place on sat with my family, since I heard a lot I was excited but in the end it was little disappointment. \nFew reasons too many red peppers ( I get it) , they were neither crunchy nor soft they were really chewy and tough. \nBeef hash was very chewy , smoked duck was very well smoky but all bones no meat, deep fried chicken nuggets were good but too many chewy red peppers did not allowed to enjoy them.\nDesert cake 20 layers of crepe was super,\nMay go back but I will make sure entree is with some sauce and no peppercorns please, it can num your mouth.\nThey could train servers to help customers like us who are clearly looking  for some help.","146":"This is a go to place for all those who love 'Hot' Chinese food. I have been given to understand that 'Mala' in Chinese means spicy. The service is polite and food comes very fast. That does not mean that they want to rush you out of their doors. Good wine selection too. Ate there the first time with my wife and loved it. When my daughter came visiting from NYC we took her there and she loved it too. Authentic cuisine per my daughter who spent 4 years in China.","147":"This bistro is known for their spicy food! I used to get take-out here all the time but decided to dine in this time. There was a bit of a wait, but the girlfriend and I ended up just sharing a table with another couple so we could get seated faster (it gets really packed during dinner time).\n\nMy favorite dishes are the Dan Dan noodles, twice-cooked pork, mapo tofu, and beef tendon. All of them are spicy, of course, but the beef tendon was a different kind of spicy. It actually numbs your mouth.\n\nThe dishes are more on the greasier side, but hey, who cares as long as the food is good.","148":"Uh.....YUUUUUUMM! This place is DELICIOUS! I love the spice and the authenticity of the dishes.  We've been there 3 times, invited different groups of family and friends, and have yet to be disappointed! \n\nThe parking can be a bit tight, as can the seating.  But any crowding wait time is well worth it!","149":"The service was very great but sadly it is not really Sichuan food (I feel like it is more like American Chinese food). Our la zi ji (spicy chicken?) didn't really have a lot of chicken. The fish was good though.","150":"Discovered this place after hearing about Chef Jianyun Ye's James Beard nomination. Since I was overdue for a visit to Chinatown, my friend and I visited on a Sunday after they opened - 11:00am. Seated immediately along with five or six other groups. Service was fast and polite - a bit shocking for Chinatown...\n\nWe ordered:\nDan Dan Noodles - 5\/5, some of the best Dan Dan noodles I've ever had. Noodles were very fresh and bouncy, and right amount of noodles to sauce.\n\nRed Oil Dumplings - 4\/5, while the dumpling skin was on point like the noodles, the stuffing inside was tougher\/meatier - not necessarily a bad thing. \n\nWater Boiled Fish Fillets - 5\/5, tender and full of spice, but they kept the heat under control. I enjoyed it thoroughly without even having to touch my water.\n\nSmoked Tea Leaf Duck - 4\/5, while the presentation of the dish was a bit lackluster, you can definitely taste the smokiness in every tender bite.\n\nThese four dishes plus two beers came out to be $45. Was enough food for at least three adults - so we had a lot of leftover.\n\nMy standard for Szechuan place has always been Cooking Girl \/ Pepper Twins. I would say Mala Sichuan is just as good, if not better. Mala also comes out better priced. Would like to come back and try the other dishes.","151":"It was my first time going to this restaurant, price was somewhat the same as other Chinese restaurants (Fufu, Mein). My problem was that the guy who gave us the check made sure to tell us we needed to tip. Not only that, he was standing over my friend's shoulder watching him write the tip on his receipt. I was telling my friend to not give him the full tip amount because he was being rude and the guy suddenly turned and gave me a cold stare. Do not go here because of their rudeness and if you do, don't let them pressure you into tipping.","152":"Amazing food, great service, and value for money!!\nWe ordered dumplings in red chili oil, bamboo shoot salad, water boiled fish and it was perfect and not too spicy. Highly recommended.","153":"We came here after a heavy breakfast, thinking that we would get a quick bite before driving back to Austin. This was our first visit to this place after a recommendation from a friend in Houston. The food was so delicious and flavorful, we had to order more. We finished all 3 dishes even though we came in not too hungry.\n\nService is top-notch. Waiters were accommodating and attentive to your needs. This is not commonly found with Chinese restaurants (real Chinese restaurants, not PF Chang or similar)\n\nWe will come back.","154":"This is our favorite restaurant for indulging in cuisine from the Sichuan province! We love the water boiled fish, crispy pepper chicken, chicken fried rice. Delicious!","155":"Went for the Dan Dan noodles and was disappointed in the small amount of meats and veggies. I literally paid $6 bucks for Sichuan's version of spaghetti with a spoonful of ground beef and a few shreds of veggies. Great spices. Terrible value. 3\/5\n\nCustomer service is actually good for a restaurant in China town. Way to shine above the rest ladies! 5\/5\n\nDecor and lighting are great here for a casual dining experience. 5\/5\n\nI'd come again but would make sure I get a decent portion of meat guaranteed in my dishes.","156":"Parking: Restaurant is in a large shopping center but expect parking to be a pain if you come during peak time. There are so many restaurants, stores and a grocery store so parking is always busy. \n\nTime and Day: Came on a Saturday at 7:00 PM and had a 40 minute wait for a table for 4 (without sharing with another table).   \n\nFood: Ordered the Lotus Tofu ($10.95) and the Tea Smoked Duck half ($12.95). The Lotus Tofu was surprisingly very good and I love the tofu and cuttlefish. The ham as described in the description is really SPAM but still complimented the dish. I recommend the Lotus Tofu so it gets a (5\/5). As for the Tea Smoked Duck half, it didn't taste any different than any other duck so I disagree when the menu says \"unique flavors.\" There wasn't any \"unique flavors.\" I say skip the duck here unless you really are in a mood for duck. The duck gets a (2\/5). Overall, food gets a (3.5\/5).\n\nService: On a busy night, expect to wave your hand to get anything. I had to wave my hand around to get my order in, water refilled, and the check. I think the waitress checked up on me once and that was it. Service gets a (3\/5). \n\nPrice: The Lotus Tofu was worth the $10.95. As for the Tea Smoked Duck, that is a little bit pricy for a plain duck. \n \nOverall: Decent Szechuan restaurant. I would only come again when it is not busy because seats are very limited in this restaurant. Overall, this place gets a (3\/5).","157":"Very tasty \u56db\u5ddd food. They offer a wide variety of spicy dishes along with items for those who prefer mild. Friendly staff, reasonably priced.","158":"Try the boiled beef and crispy chicken absolutely delish. Service was great, the wait staff is constantly checking on you. The food was prompt and hot. Highly recommend if you are ever in Houston's China Town.","159":"Dishes are flavorful and makes you increase your appetite and eat more than you should on your daily limit of carbs.","160":"This place was amazing. I was very pleasantly surprised. The spice levels used are at an appropriate level. Not too unbearable, but very tasty. The service is rapid, attentive, and impeccable. We actually had a slightly undercooked dish, but they were very gracious and cooked a whole new batch for us and even showed us the old batch alongside so we knew that it was freshly made. I can't say enough good things about it. We ordered the Mapo Tofu, the Crispy and Spicy Chicken, Eggplant in Spicy Garlic Sauce, Dan Dan Noodle, Fragrant Ribs, and Mala Pot Roasted Tilapia. They are also opening one up in Sugar Land. Exciting!!","161":"This place serves authentic and great Sichuan Food.The service is on point.The restaurant it self is clean and maintained well.If your hungry and love spicy food.This really is the place for you.","162":"Their food is all great if you like spicy food. They tend to use a lot of oil and garlic, make the food smell and taste very good. If you cant eat spicy food, this restaurant is not for you. However it's totally worth it to come over for their pricey dessert, multi layer cakes, with 4 flavors to choose from: vanilla, green tea, tiramisu and chocolate.\n\nOnly complaint is parking is horrible, need to cruise around for a while before you find a parking spot","163":"We ordered a lunch set and some special fried rice. The soup was asparagus and crab, which tasted fine as a variation of egg drop soup imo. Most of their meat dishes are hard for me to eat because it's drenched in the oily sauce that have spices I don't particularly like. The others enjoyed it though. I liked the flavors of their veggie and tofu dishes. However, I should warn you they are drenched in that clear corn starch sauce. Their fried rice was good, but definitely different in portion and quality from when they first opened. But their fish...was awesome. I don't like fish, but I liked this! \nTheir dessert looks like layered tiramisu and green tea cake. One piece was 10 though o.o\n\nOverall I think the food was good but you have to enjoy that kind of flavor.\nThe one thing I think they most improved was on the service. At least with the one girl I watched. There were at least 5 employees, but I only saw one girl really working. She was literally watching the whole room and was always there before I even thought to ask for more water. It was definitely impressive service.","164":"Wanted to check this off my Chinatown list. It's confusing to get to because the gps takes you elsewhere but it's in the same shopping center as Jusgo. Anyways the place is cute. Service is good too surprisingly for this area. Me and my brother ordered Spicy & Crispy Chicken, Dan Dan Noodles and House Spicy Fried Rice. BLOWN AWAY. Chicken was perfectly crispy and full of flavor. Also you do not need Sriracha so don't ask! Fried rice was great too and full of flavor. The dan dan noodles were okay but since I can't eat pork I had to get it without that so I don't know if that changes the flavor. Oh! Yes they also can make the dishes without pork if requested. For dessert we got the Tiramisu Mille Crepe Cake and it was the perfect ending to the meal. This place is definitely on my favorites in Chinatown now!","165":"FOOD WAS EXCELLENT!\nMy brother spent several years living and traveling in China and said the food was a trip down memory lane.  He said it was amazingly authentic and exactly what he would have eaten when in China.  Well done, kudos to the chef1","166":"Came here for Saturday lunch and ordered a fish stew, eggplant dish, and Mongolian beef dish. None of them were too spicy, and I'm not one to handle spice! The fish stew came on a burner and we could adjust the temperature of it. Don't order it unless you're very comfortable with fish bones. There are A LOT of them in this tilapia. The eggplant dish was great - a bit on the heavy sauce side, so I had it atop the white rice they serve to everyone. Same with the beef dish, but they were both very flavorful and I really enjoyed. Service was excellent and restrooms were clean.","167":"as a girl that LOVES & orders everything to be extra spicy, this place is definitely one of my favorite restaurant in chinatown !\nthat doesn't particularly mean that everything here is extremely spicy or anything, but i like all my food to have some kind of heat in it, and they have a lot of options for that.\nluckily they do mark everything on their menu with chilli peppers to indicate each dishes' spice level, but if you see anything that says \"mala sensation\" be prepared to have your entire mouth numb ! \n\nmy favorite go to dishes here are : \nSpicy Crispy Chicken - MUST GET \nEggplant in Spicy Garlic Sauce - so good, especially if you're a fan of eggplant\nMapo Tofu - my favorite place to get mapo tofu ! \n\nthis time around, i wanted to try some new items and got :\nDan Dan Noodles - has a strong peanut taste to it, which i'm not that big of a fan of, but that's just my personal preference, but my bf likes it a lot.\nTwice Cooked Pork - it was good but i've had better elsewhere, to me it was missing something to it. \nBeef Tendon - omg, so spicy and numbing ! but so good ! \nand then we also got the Mapo Tofu, so good as always. \n\nthe only reason that i rate this place 4 stars instead of 5, is that sometimes it is a little bit on the oily side, although i'm not sure if it's just the chilli oil and style of cooking, or just grease. \n\nservice is pretty average for chinatown standards, never had a big problem with anything.\n\ni highly recommend to give this place a try if you haven't yet, everything that i've ordered here has always been good and everything is very decently priced as well !","168":"I just love eating here when I need to get my spicy cravings! I haven't been in a while but today, I finally got to satisfy my cravings.\n\nMy go-to dish every time I dine in: The water boiled fish fillet. It comes out hot, tasty, spicy, and very much appealing to the eyes. It also has some cabbage and leeks at the bottom, so it's got veggies too! This is my 5-star dish! It's one of those dishes that can be eaten later on during the day or the next day and still tastes so good that you don't mind eating it as leftovers at all.\n\nMy second go-to dish: Crispy chicken. I generally order the crispy chicken, but today the waiter suggested the Spicy crispy chicken, so I got that instead, and it was spicy indeed. The spicy version is about $2 more. \n\nMy third go-to dish: Ma Po Tofu. Most Ma po tofu dishes at other restaurants have meat, but luckily for me (since I don't eat beef and pork), this dish is vegetarian. I just love the sauce in this dish. It goes super well with the white rice, and I just can't stop eating until my belly is full! \n\nAppetizers: I generally like to try the different appetizers as it is not too pricey. This time I had the green onion oil shrimp and house special cold noodle. Both dishes tasted good but as it was both cold appetizers, I felt like I enjoyed the hot entrees more this time. However, I don't think I would mind getting them again next time as well.\n\nI also got the jasmine tea which comes out in a little neat teapot! \n\nLet's just say I can't wait to go back again fo' sure!","169":"Had my first new year 2016 dinner with some friends here last night!\nWe had to wait about 20-25 minutes but was definitely worth it.\n\nWe ordered and shared:\n\nDan Dan Noodles\nRed oil dumplings\nWater boiled fish\nCumin beef\nCrispy spicy chicken\n\nMy favorites were the water boiled fish, crispy spicy chicken and dan dan noodles. Everything was full of flavor and bold spice but not the super hot lingering spicy where your tongue is numb or your salivating. (I'm sure they have that level of spice if you request). \n\nOur appetizers or 'snacks' came out after the main entrees but no complaints we had a party of four and enjoyed sharing everything. My only dislike was I bit into something a few times perhaps juniper berry? or something small and it left this awful taste in my mouth kind of sour, tangy, minty, I'm not sure it was over powering and I kept drinking hot tea to get the taste out of my mouth. It may have been in the cumin beef dish.","170":"I can't believe I've worked so close to Chinatown and have tried so few restaurants here. It seems like each new place we go is better than the last, and I'm so excited that Mala has some of the best Sichuan food  I've had yet. I was a bit hesitant to try it, since all my Yelp friends recommended the fried intestines and pig anus. I consider myself an adventurous eater, but I'm gonna draw the line there! \nOver all, the service was excellent, the food was so delicious that I think I blacked out for a bit ( the Dan Dan doodles are divine!) and they fill up quickly, so get there early for lunch. We were seated no problem as a party of 4 about 1130, but when we left around 12:30 there were several groups of people waiting for tables, so keep that in mind if you have a time crunch. \nJust writing this review has made me want Mala Sichuan, so I may be headed there for dinner!!","171":"Great little place in Chinatown.  We ordered the eggplant and the crab asparagus soup to start.  The eggplant was delicious. The soup needed a little bit sauce. I found it a little bland for schezuan.  Cumin beef, kang pao chicken, crispy chicken and the chow mein were all excellent. Might be a little spicy for some people but very close to South Asian spices. Service was a little abrupt as they are trying to turn tables and comes off as rude. Otherwise would have given them 5 stars.","172":"My taste buds truly can't get behind the Sichuan peppers. I absolutely love spicy food and usually don't enjoy a meal without it, but this wasn't exactly your stereotypical spicy. Szechuan peppers alter your taste buds and make them numb. While the fried fish was tasty, it was drowning in Szechuan peppers. My whole mouth had an unpleasant tingling sensation, and while it may be pleasant for some, I definitely can't eat and enjoy it.","173":"Very nice ambience. The location used to be a Vietnamese restaurant and since mala took over they did a good job on renovation. It's trendy and hip but just bit too dark maybe. \n\nThis is my first time here since it's opened. I usually go to the location on bellaire. I guess they cater to different crowd so the taste are bit different. \n\nTheir whole fish in bean sauce was pretty good. Fish meat is very soft and fresh and doesn't have the fishy smell. \n\nDeep Fried chicken with hot pepper is crispy outside and juicy inside but you have to eat it while it's hot.\n\nDan Dan noddle was one of my favorite since I'm from north east of China. It's chewy or people called it QQ feeling when you chew it. Perfect. \n\nSweet and sour ribs are interesting. Maybe a little bit too sweet for a dish but I like the small ribs that they used. Tasted are well marinated into the ribs. \n\nService is not the best but I would say decent.\n\nOverall it should be good place to try spicy Sichuan food in this area.","174":"We tried the Mongolian beef and the black pepper beef, both were excellent and our plates came out quick! Many other menu items I still want to try. Simple restaurant with basic tables and chairs, not a place for ambiance, just a spot to chow down on some of the best szechuan Houston has to offer.","175":"A hidden gem on Bellaire! I seriously pass by this restaurant down Bellaire so many times and have never noticed it. The sign is a bit hidden but it on the same side as B10. Today u got the change to try it and it was rest good! Fast service and attentive servers. \n\nI tried the spicy crispy chicken 5\/5 \n\ndumpling 4\/5 very different from the dumpling I had, they have a thick chilli \nsauce on top. \n \nBok choy veggie 4\/5 simple and good stir fry with ginger","176":"I do enjoy the food here very much and have liked every dish I've ordered the three times I was there. The reason for 3 stars is because of the three times, two of these times dishes were missing and had to be constantly reminded. Today my bf and I ordered one appetizer, a veggie dish and two meat dishes. I don't know about anyone else but I like my food to come out in order and I like to eat meat dishes with veggies. The two meat dishes came out first, after 20 mins we had to flag down our waitress TWICE to ask where the green beans and garlic bacon appetizer were. I believe she completely forgot and only put in the order once I reminded her. So we ate meat and then veggies towards the end of our meal.","177":"I rated this place low mainly because the food is too salty and spicy to be edible. I enjoy Sichuan  cuisine  and had visited and ate in Sichuan Province, China, before.  My advice for the chef of Mala Bistro is to cut 2\/3 of salt and 1\/2 of Sichuan peppercorns.","178":"I have been to Mala several times, and it's one of my favorite Sichuan restaurants in Houston.  There are two locations in Houston, but this one is my favorite of the two -- slightly less expensive and spicier foods.\n\nI have tried the following dishes:\n\nCrispy Cuttlefish (5\/5): Amazing cuttlefish dish.  The cuttlefish is always soft, tender, but with a crispy batter on the outside.  Unfortunately, this is no longer on the menu.  It is so amazing.\n\nSeafood Fried Rice (4.5\/5): Very tasty fried rice, although it can be a little bit oily sometimes.  The rice is never too salty, which is great.\n\nWater Boiled Fish (5\/5): Absolutely love this water boiled fish.  The serving is ample, and the fish is soft and well-spiced.  The fish does sit in a bowl of oil, which can be off-putting to some.\n\nLotus Tofu (1\/5): Bland, weird, and not good.\n\nI really enjoy Mala, and I plan on returning again and again.  One more thing though: bring back the crispy cuttlefish!","179":"Been wanting to come here for dinner and finally pulled the trigger last night, and I'm glad I did! I've had Chinese food before but never like this. Food had so much more kick and everything was so flavorful. It's already one of my top three restaurants after just one visit.\n\nAs for the food, we ordered the popular dishes such as the garlic bacon, Dan Dan noodles, mapo tofu, water boiled fish and bamboo pork. The water boiled fish is a must have and definitely my favorite out of the bunch. This place is very popular so it does get packed, so be prepared to wait on the weekends. Can't wait to come back!","180":"Have been going here for years and have brought multiple friends to this restaurant. Everyone always loved the food that was chosen. I have always enjoyed eating extremely spicy food so this place was one of my most favorite places to eat.","181":"My daughter & I had been wanting to try out this restaurant for awhile now. We love trying new places out & this one had great reviews. We weren't disappointed.  The food was delicious.  We had the red oil dumplings, mapo tofu, and crispy mala beef. I asked for the mala beef to be medium spicy, and it had just the right amount of heat. All the dishes were fresh & flavorful. Portions were large enough that we ate enough to satisfy our appetites but still had plenty of leftovers to take home. The wait staff was excellent.  Very friendly and professional.  They were very attentive to our needs without being overly intrusive. Our drinks were kept refilled. A pet peeve of mine is having to wave down a server to get my glass of ice tea refilled.  This was not even an issue here. The restaurant is small. I like that it's a small,  intimate restaurant. Tables are somewhat close, but not so close that privacy is lacking.  We look forward to many more meals here & trying out other menu options.","182":"This food here is so inconsistent. I've been here four times, two times the food was horrible and bland, the other two times everything was spicy and flavorful. But even during my good visits I still had one or two dishes that I would never order again, like the rabbit. The rabbit was nothing but bones. I would have to say it's one of worst dish I've ever ordered anywhere. The wait area is horrible, only about four little Asians can comfortably wait there while other customers step over them to leave\/enter. The dan dan noodles is the best dish there, at least 2\/4 times it was. \n\nDon't think I'll be back here for try #5.","183":"I've been to Mala about 10 times now over the last year, and it's safe to say that I'm addicted, along with half of my family and all of my friends. It's truly in a class of its own when it comes to authentic, spicy Sichuanese cuisine. As pumped as I was when the Midtown location opened up nearby, I'm still partial to the Chinatown original and have no issue braving Houston traffic for 30+ minutes to mainline that spicy, oily goodness.\n\nThe storefront is nestled in the corner of a massive plaza of Asian shops, parlors, and cafes near an enormous supermarket. The decor inside is modest and low-key, with a handful of small tables. The waiters are courteous but all-business, taking your orders efficiently in broken yet passable English. The no-frills atmosphere ensures that all your attention is focused on your food and company, as it should be. Here's my breakdown of what to get:\n\nAppetizers:\n\nDan Dan Noodle - I like this dish a lot; a lot of my friends can't stand it, so proceed at your own risk. The noodles are soft, almost mushy, with a very distinctive soy taste that is difficult to describe. \n\nChilled Mung Bean Jelly - Strange but satisfying, definitely for more adventurous diners. The little chunks have a texture midway between noodles, tofu, and jell-o.\n\nRed Oil Dumplings - Opposite of the Dan Dan noodles: my friends love these, and I'm not a big fan. The flavors are nice, but I find the tangy oiliness off-putting. \n\nThe soups are pretty good, but not exceptional. They're also gigantic. I usually opt to save room for other stuff. \n\nEntrees:\n\nSpicy and Crispy Chicken - when in Rome, you check out the Coliseum. When at the Louvre, you see the Mona Lisa. When you go to Mala, you get the spicy and crispy chicken. End of story. The dish comes with crunchy bite-sized pieces of chicken that pack in more layers of flavor than seems possible. The mountain of red chilies may seem intimidating, but the dish isn't really that spicy per se...plus, the peppercorns numb your taste buds in a kind of tingly, pleasant way. \n\nCumin Beef - absolutely incredible dish. The beef is very tender and thinly sliced, bursting with a peppery flavor from the garlic and serrano chilies. The cumin taste is there, but not overpowering. \n\nSalt and Pepper Prawns - Lightly battered fried shrimp with onions and super spicy green chilies. This dish is hit-or-miss, but is worth a try. Very sharp flavors that make your mouth water. \n\nWater Boiled Fish Fillet - My favorite seafood dish. The small chunks of white fish are very soft, almost gelatinous (in a good way) and soaked in hot flavorful oil with vegetables. \n\nEggplants in Spicy Garlic Sauce - Hands-down the best vegetable dish on the menu, in my opinion. The liquid glaze gives the soft strips of eggplant a sweet and garlicky kick. This milder dish is a good counterbalance to the other fiery courses. \n\nMala has effectively ruined other Chinese restaurants for me...a Kia just doesn't feel the same after driving a Ferrari. My one knock against the place is that the flavor of the dishes can be somewhat inconsistent--the spice, salt, garlic etc. can vary for a particular dish from visit to visit. But when the kitchen is in form, you will be hard pressed to find a better meal in H-Town.","184":"A group of friends and I decided to check this place out, we ordered crispy chicken, mangolian beef, cumin beef, house special fried rice, bok choy with garlic and red peppers, the garlic bacon, and the red oil dumplings. WE LOVED everything about it. Nothing was over sauced, or too sweet. Will definitely be coming back to try different dishes next time. \nI recommend the garlic bacon and bok choy, they were my favorite.","185":"I was honestly excited to finally try this place out due to all the raves that this place has been getting. Imagine my disappointment when Mala turned out to be just another Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. I mean, the food definitely wasn't terrible, but it wasn't that good to the point that I was like, \"Oh Em Gee!! This is so freaking delicious!!\"\n\nThe kind of service you can expect here is still the kind of service you can expect anywhere in Chinatown. So yeah, average service and average food get you average rating. Maybe the next time I come back here, my experience and my food will be better.","186":"I was in town for a few days to visit my dad (I'm from the DC area), and this was his restaurant of choice. While navigating through the parking lot was horrendous, Mala was definitely worth it. For a first timer the menu was pretty overwhelming, everything sounded good! We ordered the crispy Mala beef, water boiled fish fillet, and the potato veggies. All three were delicious but the crispy Mala beef was definitely my favorite. The three peppers on the menu were a bit intimidating, but I thought the spicy ness was at a perfect level. Eating the rice they give you also helps tone down the spice. \n\nFun fact: My Dad is that guy who will go out to eat at a Chinese restaurant and complain about how he could've made the same dish better at home. BUT he admitted that even he couldn't outdo Mala. (A pretty high praise according to his standards)","187":"Sometimes, you'll read or hear something that goes along the lines of \"If you only see ____ ethnicity people eating here, you know it's good!\" where ____ represents whatever cuisine the restaurant serves (in this case, Chinese). \n\nBut that's not the case here. Here's the Andrew Z. corollary: \"If a restaurant is PACKED full of ____ ethnicity people AND other ethnicity people eating here, you know it's amazing.\"\n\nWhy? Because Mala is so good, white people and black people and Indian people and Arab people all come here strictly through word-of-mouth praise, even though it's smack dab in the middle of Chinatown. (By the way - Mala just opened a location in the Montrose area. I wonder what the demographic looks like there.)\n\nFood to order:\n\nThe classics: Water Boiled Fish, Cumin Beef, Mapo Tofu, Dan Dan Noodles, Dry Fried Double Veggies (this is their string bean dish)\n\nIf you're feeling adventurous: Top Notch Pot of the Outlaws, Crispy and Spicy Pork Intestines,  Couples Lung Slices (a classic as well)\n\nBut honestly... I would order anything new and weird-sounding here and still expect it to be good.\n\nQuick hitting points:\n*There's almost always a wait outside, but the turnover is pretty quick\n*Most of their menu is spicy, but if you don't like spice there are still some good mild dishes\n*Rice is free and unlimited, as it should be\n*Service is decently fast for Chinatown standards\n*Food comes out incredibly fast, considering how packed they are all the time. Usually will come out within 15 minutes when I go with a group.\n*Food is preeetttyy salty, you're going to need the rice and water refills\n*If you pay in cash, there's a 5% discount","188":"So very good if you love the heat. I can't get enough of it and Mala is spectacular!!","189":"What can I say about Mala that hasn't been said already? My life was forever changed 6 years ago when I went here for the first time with some friends and got introduced to the deliciousness that is the spicy garlic eggplant, spicy crispy chicken, salt and pepper prawns, and mapo tofu. Since then, I've added several other dishes to the classic must haves including the water boiled fish, snow pea leaves in garlic sauce, and house special noodles. Special tip: always go to Mala with a big group so that you can order as many dishes as possible. Or do what I do and just order everything I want anyway and have leftovers for the week. I have moved from Houston unfortunately and the Szechuan food in Detroit will never live up to Mala standards. Hell even other Szechuan restaurants in Houston can't compete. Whenever I do come back though, Mala is always on the list of places I have to eat or else my Houston trip will be incomplete.","190":"My mouth might still be pleasantly numb from the peppercorns. \n\nMala is a Houston treat that I can't get enough of. They are consistently one of the top Chinese restaurants in Houston and now hold one of the coveted spots on the Eater 38 list.\n\nThree of us got the:\nRed oil wantons (a must!)\nHot and crispy chicken (it's mean and delicious but still loves you)\nDry fried double veggies (Szechuan Green Beans)\nSalt and Pepper Prawns\n\nAll of it was amazing and was kind of the perfect amount of food. The only knock I have is that I wish they'd shell the prawns before frying. I ate right through the shells but my companions weren't as much into the challenge. \n\nThe big fire pot also looks AMAZING. I'd definitely bring more friends to justify the fire pot. \n\nIf you haven't yet been to Mala and you like Szechuan food, you should find yourself there before the twenty minute waits for tables become and hour.","191":"First time having Szichuan and LOVED IT!\n\nWe ordered the Spicy Crispy Chicken, Water Boiled Fish (Flounder), Mala Jumbo Prawns, Three Pepper Beaten Duck, Ma Po Tofu, Red Oil Dumplings. DELICIOUS!\n\nYou can't beat that price! Only $62 for EVERYTHING!  (5% discount with cash, lol) \n\nThis place also had awesome service.","192":"This is the real deal.  They have some incredible dishes.  Boiled fish and crispy chicken are a couple of my favorites.","193":"Excellent excellent food and services. We had to call to make reservation ten min in advance and waited for 10 minutes. It was worth it!! We will go back for sure!!!","194":"This place is one of the best places I've been to so far in Houston. The food is a little on the spicy side, but as long as you order carefully, you can find food that is to your liking. I ordered the beef tendon, which is a part of the meat you have to like, but it's definitely good. It's kind of in this spicy oil sauce, and it's a little slippery. The spicy chicken is reallllyyyy good. They leave all the peppers in there so the portion looks large, but don't be fooled, it's just the right amount. It's definitely a little bit on the salty side, so I'd advice eating this with another not to salty dish and some rice. The house noodles are also good. It's kind of like raw un-stir fried noodles, so it tastes fresh with all those veggies on top.\n\nI will most definitely be back, and I'll be trying some new things on the menu!","195":"Loved this place until I opened my box of Dan Dan noodles and found an EFFIN' COCKROACH IN MY NOODLE. So disgusting.","196":"Don't know if we got in a bad day. 2 out of 4 item we want to order they are out.  Food it was good the first time I visit . But this time the flavor is just not there. Especially the Lion Head Meat Ball. Kind of disappointed since is one of my favorite dishes.\n\nOne suggestion to the wait stuff. SLOW DOWN. there is no need to keep coming back ask for order every couple minutes.","197":"This place was DELICIOUS. We ordered the eggplant is garlic sauce, fragrant ribs, and crispy mala beef. \n\nEverything was incredible. My favorite was the crispy mala beef. \n\nService was great, too. Definitely going back.","198":"Ordered to-go but next time I must dine in!\n\nWent with what these fellow yelpers suggested and it wasn't bad at all.\n\nI ordered a few things for my boyfriend and I to share:\n\n--oil dumplings - (2\/5) too doughy for me, not enough meat in the center.  the pork wasn't bad inside it just wasn't an even amount for all the starch.\n--Dan Dan noodles - Tangy sourish and again not enough ground meat in it but this was good.  Had to add some sriracha.\n--Crispy Chicken -(5\/5) I love chicken nuggets for the life of me, especially the Asian chicken nuggets. This wasn't as crispy since it was to-go but it was still good and it wasn't too spicy.  I'll definitely order this again and I will surely be back to try other items.","199":"Rice is the Central Item of a Chinese meal - and it has got to be no less than steaming hot!  The rice they served was just luke warm. When I brought this to the notice of the head waitress, she politely took the pot away, and brought another pot. In this pot only the top layer was a little warmer than before, but underneath, it was ice cold. I pointed this out, this time, to a waiter who seemed to be incharge. He too took the pot away, and a few minutes later, brought back a pot of rice. The same: luke warm. Meanwhile, our side dishes were cooling off. To save the trouble, we just managed with what was on the table, settled our bill and left. \n\nWill I revisit this bistro?  I do not think so.","200":"Best Sichuan spot in Houston. Spicy salty savory splendid deliciousness for those who wanna forget about your health for a meal and enjoy domething that burns so good going in (and out).","201":"food is fine\uff0cworst service in China Town. Been there for twice. Frist time the service hold my drink from outside and didn't give it back. second time there are some empty table but the service told us to wait. then they answer the phone\uff0ctalk to other customer\uff0cignore us. we were set on bench for 15mins and then we left went to another resturant. Bad experience made this resturant suck.","202":"This is one of the few restaurants in Chinatown and in Houston that is consistently better than average.  The spice level is higher than other Sichuan restaurants in Chinatown and elsewhere in Houston.  The food tastes fresh.  Service is good.  Only problem is that the spice level has gone down a bit and it seems that less ingredients are being used like they are using only the bare and minimum.  I tried the tea smoked duck.  I liked it but it had more fat and bone than meat.  At least duck fat is good for you so I didn't complain.  I am glad that I took out the jalapenos because it really has no place in Sichuan.  Go in the afternoons because there is a long wait during the evenings.  You should order the green tea crepe after your spicy meal.  It will help calm your stomach down.  This place has the best green tea crepe in town.","203":"Our first day back in Houston and all I wanted was Chinese food!  This place really hit the spot with there large assortment of items to choose from including all the traditional Sichuan staple items.  I greatly appreciated their ability to turn up or down the heat to suite our preferences.  \n\nTheir classic dan Dan noodles were great- chewy fresh noodles and lots of meat sauce but not overly oily.  I loved their boiled fish in hot oil- the fish just melted in your mouth.  But my favorite was definitely the hot oil wontons- juicy little packets of meat exploding with flavor and juice!  \n\nThe restaurant got super busy around noon and it seems to cater well to those who also don't speak Chinese.","204":"Local Chinese American colleagues took us here for dinner as they said it's both good and cheap. With a group of us from Los Angeles (including Chinatown and San Gabriel Valley where Chinese food is king), we are always skeptical with those two words.\n\nWe ordered: \n* Sauerkraut Fish Pot (Sliced live tilapia, cooked in a savory sour soup of sauerkraut, napa cabbage, tofu, and sweet potato vermicelli)\n* Twice Cooked Pork (Pork bacon boiled and chilled, and then stir fried with fresh leeks in sweet flour sauce and Sichuan bean curd sauce)\n* Cumin Beef (Cumin flavored beef slices saut\u00e9ed with onions, cilantro, and red chilies in mala spicy sauce)\n* Tofu Delight (Soft tofu cubes braised to perfection with bamboo slices and black mushrooms in brown sauce)\n* Saut\u00e9ed Snow Pea Shoots\n\nGOOD: Yes, all of it was good. All the flavors were fresh with subtle heat (pork, beef) and sour (soup). \nCHEAP: Between 7 of us, we each paid $11. Yes, it was cheap.","205":"So after so much hype on yelp and on the news, my family and I finally got to try MSB. \n\nWe got the garlic bacon cucumbers, stir fried green beans and bamboo shoots, fish with tofu, spicy crispy chicken, salt pepper prawns, and mala sliced tendons. \n\nEverything is heavy on the oil and salt. Sichuan cuisine tends to be that way though. It's not that spicy if you pick out those peppercorns and red peppers. The red oil itself is not that bad. The portions are very small. 4 of us ordered 6 dishes and we almost got nothing left over. And my family members eat very little. \n\nThe food did come suspiciously fast though! The 6 dishes came out together in less than 5 minutes! What?! That's awesome, but hm.... it does make one nervous doesn't it? \n\nAll in all, I'm glad to cross MSB off my list. But I think once is enough for me. PS: bring cash, they'll give you 5% off. But that also makes me upset because most restaurants give you 8% or 10% off. MSB wants to avoid paying tax but also want to keep that extra 3% govt tax for themselves. I don't get that \"you scratch my back and I'll scratch your back\" feeling. It's more like....\"you scratch my back and I'll scratch your back, and give you a foot massage\" or something like that.","206":"My go-to for work trips in Houston.  So good I'll go here before checking into my hotel.  This place scratches my Sichuan itch in a way I can't find in Austin or DFW. Favorites include the spicy crispy chicken, cumin lamb, red oil wontons, Dan Dan noodles, and eggplant in garlic sauce are all great!","207":"Not so good food and bad service. Waitress demands more tips. This place reminds me of business places who only think about themselves and not customers. There are too many good restaurants in China Town to try. No chance if they continue this poor quality even with 5% discounts when pay with cash.  Eventually, the Truth will be revealed to public. I have wasted my meal here one evening and I don't think that I will return.","208":"This was the first Sichuan place I went to in Houston and now I compare all other to this place. The red oil dumplings, spicy crunchy chicken, and Dan Dan noodles are a must. Enjoy the heat and the numbing that sets in soon afterwards. It's well worth it. \n\nAlso pay in cash and get a discount.","209":"Let's just start off that this place is not in the best looking parking area but don't be fooled, the food is worth the trip. Disclaimer: food is SPICED up so you'll love it if you like spicy food! If not, don't come. Kidding, come anyway. Also it's greasy but hey it's Chinese.\nThese are the rates for the 5 items me and my group ate all of:\n\nDinner\n-Water boiled fish 4\/5 whole fish for only $11 it's amazing for the amount of flavor it's packed with\n-Eggplant with spicy garlic sauce 3.5\/5 it is sweet and has minimal spice but it's so tasty\n-House spicy fried rice 4\/5 it has beef and lots of peppers that make this a super yummy dish to try out with a group\n-Spicy crispy chicken 5\/5 YOU MUST TRY, that's all I can say\n-Dan Dan 2.5\/5 idk why there was a lot of really great reviews this wasn't the best and the gravy was super heavy even though everything already was, this was even heavier. But for $6 it wasn't bad\n\nI had dinner style with 4 others, we really enjoyed ourselves. We went to eat at 5pm on a Monday and it was just us and one other table. The store had just opened but the way they were setting up looked like they knew the rush would eventually come so guys, check it out!","210":"Service was prompt. Very clean & authentic. We loved the dumplings. Food was hot and mild spicy (note we are spice fanactics). We also enjoyed the beef hot pot & the crispy chicken. Will go back, we wanted to be a little more adventurous with our selections and didn't read up like we should have prior. Great add to our restaurant favs! Oh and bring cash... it's a 5% discount with cash!","211":"I went here on a recommendation from a friend who is from China. He has excellent taste in food and didn't disappoint this time. \nI ordered the Mala Beef Tofu, baby bok choy with garlic, and the red oil dumplings. Everything was phenomenal! The beef is spicy and flavorful and a little tangy. It has small chunks of soft tofu, green onions, and it all sits in a delicious red sauce. The sauce got into everything on my plate, which was just fine with me. The dumplings had a sweet sauce, which contrasted nicely with the spiciness of the pork inside. The bok choy made a nice counter balance to all the other strong flavors. It was saut\u00e9ed and largely unflavored except for some pieces of garlic and fresh ginger. \nTheir hot tea rounded out the meal. \nThe service was quick and the whole meal cost about $25 and was more than enough for 2 people. Next time I'm in Houston, I'll definitely come back.","212":"A friend recommended this restaurant. The food was excellent.\n\nWe had several dishes and they were all very good. \n\nI recommend the eggplant, the bok choy, the cumin beef, all are excellent. \n\nThe prices are very reasonable. It is now one of my favorite Chinese restaurants.","213":"Continue with my last review and the owners feed back. First of all, after I said there's roach in my rice (and apparently along with 3 other customer in the same day!), Mala Sichuan not only refuse to admit the mistake, not working on their hygiene issue but point out I don't have the ability to differentiate cockroaches and beetles. They claimed that it's weevil and have it in your food does not have any harm on you. Let me just say that, if this is Mala Sichuan's standard, EVERYONE should be aware of it. Second of all, it was a German cockroach, I'm 100% sure of it. And having any kind of insects in your food is not acceptable anywhere else. Finally, the waitress took away my dish after I pointed out there was a roach in it, and never sincerely apologized for it. Now I know why, because this is the company culture. And this is how Mala Sichuan treats its customers -- the customers falsely accusing them, Mala Sichuan doesn't have any issue didn't make any mistake but they apologize just for the sake of it. I'd like to say, save the meaningless apology to yourself, and clean your kitchen for other customers healthy.\n\nGood luck to everyone who still goes there!","214":"The service here was SO efficient. It was crowded when we walked in but immediately got a table AND got our food in 10 minutes!! If you like spicy food you are going to LOVE this place. We got the jalape\u00f1o chicken dish and it was fried to perfection. The wantons in the red ginger oil was great too but note that these aren't dry wantons, they're more like dumplings (still good though). Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Houston.","215":"This is probably one of my favorite Chinese restaurant- Sichuan style. The place is fast in terms of swrvice- though sometimes there is a bit of wait for dinner. We typically order the cold Dan dan noodles, water spinach with garlic, lotus root with chilli peppers, the water boiled fish, and crispy spicy chicken. I would definitely come back for their food..","216":"****3\/2\/2017 UPDATE REVIEW****\nOne night I left my credit card in the bill fold.\nThe manager, I don't know his name but he looks like a younger and much skinner Donnie Yen so we will refer him to as Donnie Yen, found me in the bakery across the street. I thought I forgot to pay or something but it turns out Donnie was looking for me because he wanted to return the credit card I forgot. That was a big relief because he saved me so much time and hassle from reporting a lost card to my bank. This is why Mala is my favorite restaurant in town. GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE AND MOST OF ALL AMAZING 3 MICHELIN STAR  (in my opinion) LIKE DELICIOUS FOOD AT AFFORDABLE PRICE!\n****END OF 3\/2\/2017 UPDATE******\n\n\nI eat here 3-8 times a week. One week in January 10 times. I'm surprised they don't know my name by now. My girl friend broke up with me because she got jealous of me eating their food more than hers. Good riddance. I'm not into raw vegan stuff anyways. I had 90-95% of the menu. I want to try everything here because EVERYTHING HERE IS GOOD! BEST MAPU TOFU IN THE COUNTRY!!! My favorites here are (in no order): Mapu Tofu, Cumin Lamb, Couples Lungs, Mala Beef Tendon, Mala Pot Roasted Tilapia, Chengdu Style Tilapia, Water boiled beef, Water boiled fish, Ants on the Tree, Fried Crispy Pork Intestine (so good!), Pork Intestine noodles, Dan Dan Noodles, Devourable Beef something, Mung Bean Jelly (looks like noodles spicy sweet savory), Top Notch Pot of the Outlaws (Best named Dish award from me), Prosperity at 5AM, Egg Plant, Red Oil Wontons, and few other things I forgot but everything here is good. Chances are if you look around the place you'll find me eating here. I'm the guy taking pictures of my food with the camera phone. Come say hi or ask for recommendations. Service here is best in china town. They speak good English and know about each item on their menu well.","217":"Authentic food at a good price.  Love their Mapo tofu, Kimg Pao chicken, and Crispy chicken.  Consistent food keeps us coming back!","218":"I have been going to mala at least once a month for the last three years it's my favorite Chinese restaurant but one thing I didn't like was when my bill was $50 I tipped $6 and then the waiter comes and insults me saying that's it what kind of tip is this and kept begging for a tip first of all he did a HORRIBLE job and was rushing to kick us out two hours before t closed and the restaurant wasn't even 50% occupied due to this service I'm going to cooking girl never will come back here","219":"Mala has some of the best Sichuan food along the Bellaire strip, I'm always happy with what I order there even if it's something new. If you like spicy and you don't mind your mouth feeling a little weird after biting directly into a peppercorn then this is the place for you. \n\nThe crispy mala beef is my favorite but a new contender is the basil chicken. It's prepared like the many basil chicken nugget dishes that a lot of tea shops nearby will make it. But they add a signature blend of seasoning that's sweet with some heat. Not nearly as spicy as other dishes, this is one for you if you're not ready to dive into the multitude of peppers in other dishes. \n\nThey've recently expanded and made their menus out of nice leather bindings. It's a good thing to see them grow and get more customers. I highly recommend this place if you're in the area, or visiting from out of town and want something a little more traditional compared to other Chinese restaurants.","220":"Great flavor, not as spicy as I expected though. Was looking forward to a lot of heat. But the flavors were great and service was friendly and fast.","221":"We have been regular there and they definitely lose us today.\nThe management charged us from a server mistakenly served us wrong dish and we accepted it as we didn't know it wasn't for us (we shared table with another couple and it's their dish) after some arguments we ended up not paying for that dish but the management asked a server to come and opened our left over food bag to take away the unpaid food after it's all packed. \n\nIt's the rudest and unfair restaurant I've been to.","222":"Located at the corner of a plaza. Could be slightly hard to spot at first. Parking can be a tad bit hard to find during peak times. Perhaps see if there is some parking in front of the Jusgo supermarket which is in an adjacent plaza. \n\nJust going to put it out there, I think that this place is a bit overhyped. It's not bad. The food was decent, but I would definitely say a bit on the small side. \n\nThere are a couple big round tables that are available if you have a bigger party. Most of the tables here are rectangular in shape that can seat about 4 people. They also have a couple of private rooms that you can use which require a minimum of $150 spent on food before tax\/tip (never had this before).\n\nThe service was pretty good. No complaints. \n\nThis place often has a line, especially around peak times. Definitely try to come early if you can. they have a small waiting area that can seat about 3-4 people. Others will generally just have to stand inside\/outside the restaurant until their names are called.\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't really come back unless a friend wanted to meet up here. I think it's okay for a first try.","223":"I've been here quite a few times, my latest visit was this past weekend and service def has improved. I only look at yelp reviews to see what others recommend in ordering so I'll get right to the point!\n\nDan Dan Noodles- 3\/5. Probably wouldn't order again. Might be obvious but make sure to mix it otherwise it's going to lack flavor that resides in the spiced ground pork at its base.\n\nRed Oil Dumplings- 4\/5. Not too oily. I actually really enjoyed the flavor it gives.\n\nSpicy Crispy Chicken- 5\/5. My only complaint is that there's too many red peppers on the actual dish and the peppercorn taste makes your mouth start to go numb so I can't keep shoveling chicken pieces in my mouth... :(\n\nCrispy chicken- 2.5\/5 I assumed it would taste like the spicy crispy chicken just without the spice but it's a rather dry and salty dish. I'd rather go through the numbing process with the spicy crispy chicken that packs more flavor.\n\nWater boiled fish fillet- 5\/5. Yes. YES. This is a must try. Order this even if you don't like fish.\n\nCumin beef- 3.5\/5 I ordered this based off recommendations but I did not enjoy the flavor nor how spicy it turned out to be though everyone has their own preference, this just wasn't mine.","224":"Great food and noisy but would go there in a heart beat... the service is quick and prompt and everything is so unique and so dofferent","225":"We ordered Water boiled fish, Crispy Chicken and Mala Tofu. Tofu was amazing I'm craving it now. It's a small place and gets pretty crowded. We got in at 5 to 12 and were able to get a table. Not sue if they take reservations. I'll be back.","226":"Not sure if pleasure or pain... or both? This best describes my feelings towards Mala.\n\nI'll echo the sentiments of my fellow yelpers that the spicy crispy chicken, mapo tofu, and dandan noodle are delicious. I'd add to that the spicy lamb and also recommend getting a veggie like the bok choy or eggplant to help balance out the spice.","227":"Decent food. If Sichuan is what you are looking for I don't think it will disappoint.\nLocation is a lil shady tho.  Neighboring stores look a mess.","228":"OMG!! Just came here few days ago after Valentine's Day  and the food is really really salty. Not even one dish is decent. I did mention it to the waitress but not sure if she understand me. Although I did come here 2 weeks ago and it wasnt that bad so I came back the second time but I was too disappointed. I hope the owner of Mala's actually read this comment and improve the food here. Just too sad a nice place like this is ruined.","229":"I prefer going to this location over the one in Montrose because the parking is so much easier here. This is one of my favorite places to take out-of-towners because Szechuan food is a little different from your normal fried rice and egg rolls. Word to the wise: they do not exaggerate when they rate their hot pepper levels. I typically get the dan dan noodles (appetizer size) and cucumbers, and then whatever protein dish catches my fancy. Rice comes free with the meal of course, the best way to get the spices off your tongue. \n\nYou get a 5% discount if you pay your bill in cash, but the prices are reasonable to begin with.","230":"I was confused why the red chili dumplings are known as a big hit here. I thought they essentially tasted like dumpling wrappers in chili oil with a little bit of meat. I was glad though, that they weren't overly spicy and had a touch of sweetness. \n\nI ordered the crispy chicken, but thought it was too salty. I did enjoy the ma po tofu and pork dish though.","231":"4 stars but really 3.5 for tonight - all based solely on taste and expectations from prior experiences. I'm leaving there tonight confused. Was it a bad night? Do they serve less spicy and mouth numbing food to their white customers now? Did Mala get too big for its britches? I know they are opening up several new restaurants across town. The mapo tofus portion shrunk in size while the price is now comparable to their restaurant in Montrose. The spicy crispy chicken was really just crispy and barely spicy. I didn't see the crushed Szechuan peppercorns coating the dishes like I normally would. It  always used to be  worth the hike to the restaurant in Chinatown because the food was cheaper and better. Now it's not really worth it. The taste is just lacking. If you are going to name your restaurant Mala then you better bring the Mala. They no longer have the steel chopsticks and have replaced them with the bamboo disposable ones like you would find in any Chinese restaurant. Obviously not the biggest deal but I miss the smooth mouth feel of the steel chopsticks. I'm hopeful this was just an off night and not a sign of their food and quality declining. Service was good - it always is especially by Chinatown standards. Mala was my first taste of authentic Szechuan cuisine and I used to be so excited to bring out of town guests here for the experience. Now I'll probably take them elsewhere since I can't count on Mala being reliable. I left here wondering if they changed the recipes or fired the prior cook? Many of the dishes were far more salty than normal.","232":"This place is the real deal for Sichuan! I lived in Asia for two years and Marla's food is better than many I remover there. Vary tasty and affordable family-style dining. Boiled beef a favorite!","233":"Authentic Sichuan foods, the wait time is long but it was well worth it, service is just subpar, but the food is on the top of the Houston Chinese restaurant list. The price is cheap consider the quality of the food.","234":"Incredible.\n\nGet the whole fried tilapia with the sauce on the side, the buns, and a great helping of the bukchoy with peanuts and a canned tea. Seriously cannot recommend this place enough. I loved it and would go back again if I ever go back to Houston.","235":"Hands down, some of the best food in Houston. For some reason I haven't had the greatest experiences with Chinese food here in htown, but Mala has got me eating my words. Parking is absolutely brutal, especially on the weekend since the korean grocery store is so close by, but that's to be expected (it adds to the authentic experience). My service experiences have been just fine. The restaurant always seemed to be packed so anticipate waiting.  (Ambiance: 4\/5) \n\nLoved the food here. I ate brunch here, left super full for the rest of the day. Honestly haven't had a bad order from this place. Tons of vegetarian options, my favorite is the lotus root with chilis -- I could eat this dish every day of my life, I love lotus root. (Food: 5\/5) \n\nThis place has me excited for authentic Chinese food here in Houston. Can't wait to find more places like this one!","236":"Great food! Fried chicken was a little too fried. Loved the spice level and ambience overall!","237":"Hot and sour soup tastes great. Pepper beef is delicious. Good customer service. English\/Asain  music background. $$. Nice simple bright atmosphere.","238":"The One Where Sandy Introduced a Chinese Restaurant to her Parents.\n\nThe statement above is rare.  In fact, it's so rare that it's the first time this happened!  No joke, my family loves Sichuan food.  What's not to like, it's spicy, oily, delicious, and if you're like me then you'll end up sweating your calories out while you're eating (no joke).  \n\nMala Sichuan has made a name for itself.  There's always a line and non-Chinese folks know about it, talk about it, and even write about it.  So with all that said, it's a venue I have to bring my parents to.  For 5 of us, we ordered about 10 dishes and walked out paying under $20\/person.  We had some leftovers, but not much.  \n\nWhat's not to miss: \n* salted, chilled cucumbers (it's an appetizer)\n* ma po tofu\n* stir-fried garlic green veggies\n* tea flavor duck\n* spicy chili oil wontons\n\nThe food is not as spicy as traditional sichuan food.  To me, it wasn't even spicy at all (even with all the red chilies on the plates and chili oil everywhere).  I thought it was just me, but apparently everyone at my table agreed.  However, it's still very yummy.  The food is a bit \"Americanized\", but it was still a good and satisfying dinner.  Service was great.  Food came out fast and there was no wait on a Tuesday night!  \n\nCompared to the other Sichuan restaurants in Bellaire, you get a bit less for what you're paying.  Overall, I still liked it and would come back to try other dishes.  However, if you're hunkering for SPICE, then I would recommend you tell them to put on the heat.","239":"We ordered so much food since we were hungry. Food was ok. Hubby liked the Two stir fry chicken dish. The eggplant with garlic was too sweet for me. Why the one star? I ordered the whole fried fish and was pretty excited since they actually have fresh fish swimming in the acquarium. My issue was that when the fried fish came out, there was no meat on it. I eat whole fish all the time (w\/ head and tails and all), and in my opinion, the cut most of the fish fillets out and let me with a big fried fish with no meat.  That dish was about $16\/17 dollars and there was hardly any fish meat but just the outer bones\/tail and maybe 2 small pieces of fish filet on it. I will never go here again. I know how a full fried fish looks like and how much meat should be on the fish and the one I was served hardly had any meat on it. That is not cool. Never again.","240":"Super fast service when I was here. Absolutely delectable spices .i like the fish most btw","241":"After continually seeing and hearing a lot of great things, today we were in the area and had lunch.\nLarge menu with a lot to choose from, come hungry!\nStarters we selected were the cold bacon wrapped cucumber and hot red oil dumplings.\nOur mains were crispy beef and spicy & crispy chicken.\n\nWe ordered everything at the same time but it was delivered when ready.\nFirst they sat a big covered bowl of perfectly cooked white rice.  A few minutes later we got the garlic bacon and crispy Mala beef.  A little while later the spicy and crispy chicken.  A few more minutes the dumplings.\nThis allowed us to eat some of each dish before more arrived.\nThe flavors in each dish are tasty, good layers that build the more you eat.  The chicken wasn't spicy the first few bites but towards the end our mouths were flaming.\nOur favorite is the red oil dumplings followed closely by the spicy crispy chicken.\nWe found the beef a bit too crispy and not enough meaty texture.  It reminded us of jerky.\nThe garlic bacon is definitely a different texture than we are use to, but we did finish them.\nOur disappointments were their hot tea machine was not working and they were out of duck.","242":"Seems like this place is super popular and there was a wait when we got there.  I got there first so I was trying to get a table for 11 and the waiter told me that we could get a table in one of the rooms but there's a $150 spending minimum (if not the wait would be super longer).   I'm not sure if she tells everyone that or not but I just agreed. We ordered a lot of food and we were only at 80 bucks.... So we ended up ordering a bottle of wine,  more food, and also to go. Next time, I will not go for the $150 minimum spending.  \n\nSo, once everyone got there we were still waiting for the people in the rooms to leave so we could be seating, let's say since I got there it was probably about 45-55 minute wait.  She told me that one room has been there for almost 2 hours and the other table was there for over an hour and a half. I went to look and everyone was done eating and playing on their phones, but the waiter told me she couldn't  do anything about it,  I was like whatever... Honestly, she could have speeded up the process.  \n\nOkay, now to the actual food and service.  So, we order many dishes but what it all came down to was all of them were way too salty except the cucumber dish. Each bite that I took, I felt like I was contributing to hypertension!!!  The food was definitely different and authentic but nothing extraordinary that caught my attention to say I need to go back.  I will more than likely not go back and it's something I could live without.  If you've never been then I guess you shall give it a go just to say you've been there, if you really must.  The food came out pretty quickly but getting a waiters attention after they left the room was tough. I had to get up multiple times to ask for stuff.  Also,  they were not paying attention to water and drinks, keep in mine we were downing lots of water because the salty food.  Therefore, the service wasn't that great. \n\nOverall, I didn't really care for the salty salty food, the service wasn't that great, it was not worth the wait. The only good thing was the food came out quickly the first time around but we were missing a few dishes that took awhile to come out.  In my opinion, this place is overrated, there's better food out there, and I doubt I'll be back.","243":"Been several times.  Always good.  Dan dan noodles, red oil dumplings, kao pao chicken, stir fry pork.  Service excellent.  Love the plates on the wall.","244":"Came because of all the good reviews but was disappointed. Not sure if I came on a bad day or this is how Sichuan food is supposed to taste and I just didn't personally like it. The spicy chicken was barely spicy. The duck stew tasted like a bucket of salt was dumped in it, stopped eating it after the first bite.","245":"No brown sauce #2 in sight! ;-). Seriously, glad to find a place that knows a handful of dried chili's and some garlic does not make Sichuan.","246":"Thanks for recommendation from servicer, I really like black pepper beef!!! Yummy. I order mala pot roasted tilapia. If you like whole fishy and spicy, it will be a good choice. Service is quick and helpful. I will come back soon. By the way, the dessert- crepes ( green tea ) !!!!! Delicious :) try other flavors next time .","247":"Ok,  this place was busy and gets raving reviews by many. I guess this type of chilli oil soaked cuisine is just not for me.\n\nWe dine there for lunch yesterday and both my husband and I suffered from diarrhea. It's just grease and spiciness for him, but it's definitely food poisoning for me. The only difference is that I ate the raw green onions on the fish and he didn't. I can pinpoint the source because that was the the only meal we had together without other family members and we are the only ones sick.\n\nWe love spicy foods and we often eat Indian, Thai, Korean and crawfish without incidence. So beware of excessive chili oil and raw green onions people ... and kudos to those who can tolerate this.","248":"I instantly loved this place during my first visit and is now one of my Chinatown faves! \n\nMy fave dishes are: Chongdu fish (a fresh, steamed tilapia), Dan Dan noodles, and the sesame oil bamboo shoots. =) \n\nI like the unique decor on the wall w\/ all the vintage plates too.","249":"We came for my mom's birthday and ate family style. Amazingly my favorite thing we ate was the Mapo tofu. I'm addicted! We enjoyed the spicy crunchy chicken, cumin lamb and two pepper duck as well, and mom liked the house cold noodles.  We could have lived without the dumplings but the over all experience was great. \n\nSeriously though, the tofu convinced my husband that he doesn't hate all tofu after all. I'll be dreaming about it for weeks!","250":"I've been a bit spoiled. Ever since I started cooking from Fuchsia Dunlop's books it takes a lot for a sichuan restaurant to impress me. Though Mala Sichuan was better than a lot of them, I would still say it's within range of a practiced home cook.\n\n * couple lungs - which is not lungs at all but thin slices of beef, tendon and tripe with crushed peanuts and spicy oily sauce. I would have preferred more crushed peanuts and cilantro but the \"meat\" was tender, toothsome and good. Not too spicy.\n\n * sour spicy noodles - I found these a little bland\n\n * red oil wontons - the wontons weren't impressive and the sauce was not very flavorful\n\n * water boiled fish - I really liked this dish and since it's deep fried fish it's not something I would bother trying to make at home. Pieces of deep fried fish swimming in a red oily sauce. Good spice and mala.\n\n* chung qing chicken - not the freshest fried chicken, maybe the oil is too old? Not sure but though it was good it's not the best I've had\n\nOverall if you're looking for authentic sichuan food this place hits the spot.","251":"Went here a few months a go, service is good, the food came out fast and taste good, tried their duck but it's okay...but make sure you order the salt pepper shrimp its really good...","252":"Lots of amazing flavor. Spices on another level. My wife couldn't eat her choice because it was too spicy. I loved it!!!  She won't go back, but I'll look for an opportunity to go back. Great looking restaurant and good service.","253":"So hot and so good. If you're a fan of Sichuan style Chinese food then this should be on your been there ate that list for Houston. We've eaten here a few times now and I can maintain that its's my favorite for spicy Sichuan Chinese food. \n\nThis being the original location, before their Montrose iteration, you'll find this place nestled deep in the way back of a chinatown shopping center off Bellaire. Parking can be challenging at times, and I've seen a line form out the door around popular rush hours,so be prepared. Interior is the typical dropped ceiling and no frills decoration, besides a wall filled with beautiful multi-colored and varying designed plates. Something else that may pop out at you is that there's a live fish tank over by the kitchen door where you can pick out your tilapia for a whole page in the menu devoted to fresh tilapia dishes.  \n\nService is spotty. We've had waiters at times that were hard to flag down, vanish into thin air, rusty on English, or really into whispering the orders as they place them on your table. But, overall, they get you what you want quickly and with a smile. \n\nThe food is the attraction and if you like it spicy, you'll be very happy. There are plenty of great sichuan dishes to choose from that range from the mild to the pallet searing. I've fallen into a rhythm of red oil dumplings to start, which are fairly popular, and then ordering braised beef with hot peppers and peppercorns. I recently tasted the tofu in hot oil and peppers and was surprised considering my usual distaste for all things tofu. It does a great job of soaking in the spicy flavors. Other notables were the beaten duck as well as the spicy chicken. Both are a dry served meat dish with a kick, mixed in with hot peppers. The only thing I ever ordered that was a let down for the table was the tea smoked duck, just not what I was expecting and rather bland. Probably user error though as it tasted just like it was smoked in....tea. All dishes are family style helpings if my memory serves me, so get in a sharing mood. \n\nAll in all, Mala is a great place for proper sichuan at a reasonable price. Come hungry and you'll still leave with leftovers, sweat stains and a full belly.","254":"This place is amazing!!\n\nI have my go to dishes dan dan, water boiled fish (sounds boring but so flipping good!) and the 3 pepper beaten duck. Your lips will tingle and you will start to sweat. Surprisingly some of my favorite dishes are the veggies! Get adventurous and try the basil intestines because they are really good!\n\nDont know why people say the dan dan noodles are overrated...","255":"Really looking forward to it but so disappointed! The prices are not bad it the food was extremely salty and the Dan Dan mien was okay and the cold noodle house was below average the taste was off. We ordered the spicy beef with peppercorn and its soooo salty. Spinach was not so good and the total was$37","256":"This is one of my favorite Sichuan style restaurants. Here's what we would recommend. \nSpicy crunchy chicken\nTwice cooked pork \nDan dan noodles \nMapo tofu \nGreenbeans","257":"I would come back here for the fast service, easy to find parking, and the dan dan noodles. Those noodles were so delicious and cheap! Maybe the mapo tofu. I thought it was pretty average, but I loved the softness of the tofu and the combination of simple plain white rice was filling. My food came out pretty quickly, but it made me question if it was fresh or not. I also tried the red oil dumplings and garlic bacon. All of which were good entrees, but nothing that really made me want to come back for it. Also who knew eating with metal chopsticks would make it 10x more complicated? Especially red oil dumplings? Wow. I was struggling to eat those! The garlic bacon was very cooling especially since most of the dishes comparable to that one were pretty spicy.\n\nSpeaking of spiciness... All the flavors by the end of the night ended up all tasting the same to me! Literally everything started to taste the same and it was hard to differentiate between the dishes because nothing really stood out. \n\nIt's not a place I would rave about, but over... I'd come back here for the dan dan noodles and the fact that your food comes out swiftly. That's about it.","258":"We went back to the restaurant with a party of 11 people. We had reserved a private room (they have 3) but the previous party arrived late and would go an hour after our reservation time. We ended up at a regular table. Not as nice as the private room but not terrible.\n\nThe food was awesome as always. The Crab and Asparagus soup was great with lots of crabmeat chunks. The Black Pepper Beef dish was just spicy enough without blowing out your palette. The Chow Meins with Lo Mein noodles have a tasty sauce and a lot of veggies and proteins.\n\nOne negative was ordering the Surf Clam appetizer and it never came. Had to cancel it while eating my main dish. From now on we will order main dishes only after we get our soups and appetizers so the meal is times right. They brought out mains with the soup and appetizers so the mains were getting cold by the time you started on them. This is the reason for 4 star instead of 5 star.\n\nService was really good. Our waiter was extremely helpful and responsive. I would love to have the same waiter every time. Overall the experience was fabulous. So many items on the menu I want to try in future visits!","259":"I want to give this place a 5 star rating and if it was solely based on food I would. The food is spicy and delicious. I recommend the cumin beef and spicy crispy chicken. \n\nThe only issue that I have is that when you have a party of 3-4, they don't go ahead and give you the table that seats 6. Instead we have to wait around for 20 minutes for a 4 seat table to open up.\n\nAgain if my review was based solely on food, I would give this place 5 stars","260":"I came here on Christmas day with my family. This place was packed, and I hear that it's always crowded, so be prepared for a wait! The good was great, and very reasonably priced. \n\nBoiling Fish (4.5\/5) - Great spice without overdoing it. Nice portion size\n\nCumin Lamb (4\/5) - A bit too much spice (not heat spice but spices) for me, but still tasty\n\nSpicy Crispy Chicken (4.5\/5) - Addictive and crispy\n\nLotus Tofu (2\/5) -  I just did not like this dish. It was pretty bland and mushy.\n\nSeafood Fried Rice (3\/5) - Pretty good but standard","261":"One of my favorite places. Great customer service and the food is always fresh and well-prepared. I only wish I drove up that way more often!","262":"The best spicy and tasty Chinese dishes . The prices are excellent and if you pay cash you get a 5% discount. \n\nMust get :\nCrispy spicy chicken,  so good ,sweet and spicy with a crunch.  Goes great with spicy fried rice and their eggplant !","263":"I'm obsessed with Schezuan food because of this place! My favorite dishes are dan dan noodles and bacon\/cucumber wrap. Schezuan dishes are packed with red chili peppers and of course Schezuan peppers. There is a balance of sweetness and saltiness in their food. Even the Mongolian beef was so good, different from other Chinese restaurants. The best Mongolian beef I've ever had. The service is fine but kinda slow because they are so packed every time I go. I love this place and will definitely keep coming back.","264":"I had to see what the hype was about. I came with my mother and we ordered the dan dan noodles, garlic bacon appetizer, and crispy spicy chicken which seemed to the the popular consensus among the tables around us. I liked that the app sizes and dan dan noodles were reasonably priced and sized like apps. The chicken was really good, but was a little more expensive for the amount of chilis in the dish. Overall great experience. Granted, we went around 9:00 so there wasn't much of a wait.","265":"Mala Sichuan Bistro has been on my radar pretty much since I came back to Houston after college, and my family finally decided to switch it up from our usual Chinese restaurants to eat here.\n\nFYI: \"mala\" is a combination word in Chinese. \"Ma\" refers to numb, \"la\" refers to spicy. Together it's the cooking specialty of the Sichuan province, but they can obviously be separate.\n\nI think I was too hyped up for Mala...I thought it was okay. We ordered 6 dishes: water-cooked fish, eggplant, smoked duck, red oil wontons, twice-cooked pork, and shrimp with green onions.\n\nGood:\n* Water-cooked fish. Spicy, garlicky, oily. Good with rice!\n* Eggplant. Garlicky, not overly mushy\n* Red-oil wontons. This one is personal preference: these are doughier for wontons, but I like dough. If you want paper thin skin, you won't like these.\n\nBad:\n* EVERYTHING HERE IS SO GREASY. I know a lot of things are topped off with spicy oil, but it just sort of coats your mouth and destroys the palate.\n* Smoked duck: overly salty. Not \"ma\" or \"la\" at all!\n* Shrimp with green onions. Too much \"ma\" flavor that makes the dish really unappetizing. It isn't spicy, though.\n\nThe food at Mala isn't actually *bad*, but there are other Chinese restaurants that I would prefer eating at than here. There are a couple of tasty dishes, though, and people are willing to wait to eat here. Definitely give it a try!","266":"I can't believe I just had the chance to try this restaurant. Their food is delicious. When I think of Sichuan I think of the dried chili peppers, and when I think of peppers I think spicy. To be honest, it is spicy but it's not anything you cannot handle. The flavors for all our dishes were a great blend and kept you wanting more. Everything here is family style and is meant to be shared. Note: there was a group of 5 of us, and it took them almost 10 minutes to seat us.There were plenty of open tables. But I'm not expecting high service when I go to chinatown.\n\nWe ordered the following:\nbeef jerky - which is served cold and has a soft yet chewy texture. It's good!\nred chili dumplings - probably one of my favorite dishes!! It wasn't that spicy either, it was a little sweet which made it a great surprise! I think I could eat a whole dish to myself. \nmapo tofu - a little spicy but that's what makes it good. I've tried the mapo tofu from a handful of places and this place is probably one of my favorite.\nfish dish - I don't remember the name of our fish, but it was so good! The fish was soft and melt in your mouth type of feeling. Order any of them and you won't be disappointed.\ndan dan noodles - must try this! I'm not a fan of dry noodles, but they made it tasty! This the last dish to come out so I was full from the other dishes but I still had two servings of this.","267":"Tried Mala for the first time a few weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised. Location is excellent and the place is really nicely decorated. Ended up ordering what seemed like the most popular dishes from Yelp since we weren't too familiar w Sichuan cuisine. Started off w the red oil dumplings. Then the  dan dan noodles. And finished w the water boiled fish and mapo tofu. \n\nHoly crap, everything was spicy. The red chili oil dumplings were slightly on the sweeter side which helped. Loved all the dishes but couldn't really feel my mouth after a while. Definitely an experience.","268":"This location is far better than it's sister location on Westheimer however the same menu items aren't offered and some of the flavors are different than what is offered at the other location, even with the same dish. The pricing is fair and the food is great here!\n\nThe service is great, well mannered wait staff, however, Mala seems to have an issue of splitting checks of parties larger than two. Bring cash, or find a way to pay each other back if you want to split the check. They seem to want to avoid credit card fees by limiting how many times a check can be split, even after telling them ahead of time that this is what is preferred, and them saying it's no problem. Problems arise when the check finally comes. Quit trying to avoid fees, and the service would be 5 stars.","269":"I miss the mapo tofu. Depending on where you go it's made differently everywhere- some places have peas and mushrooms etc. this place is how it's is supposed to be. Tofu, oil, bits of ground meat and scary stain your clothes red. \nI'm still trying to find a place on the east coast like this place.\n\nThe Dan Dan mien had no flavor. I had to use the sauce from the dumplings in chili oil to flavor them.\nBy the way- those dumplings were this interesting combo of spicy and underlying sweet.\nIf I'm back in Houston I'm coming for you. \n\nOh. The language barrier was a tad interesting. My mandarin is terrible, the guys English was ehh and he didn't understand Canto. So yeah it was a lot of pointing.","270":"Service : 5 Stars \nService was excellent, courteous, thoughtful and responsive.\nD\u00e9cor: Neat ,clean and presentable with an atmosphere conducive to enhance an enjoyable meal.\nFood:\nEgg plant with garlic was excellent and as advertised.\nThe crab meat with asparagus lacked the asparagus but what was there were micro pieces of green that were the asparagus. False advertising no asparagus..\nDan Dan noodles would be a superb dish but the sauce provided you with salt shock.\nThe Tilapia tasted like it was precooked with a minimum of fish and a maximum of bones.\nWe plan to return two more times, avoiding the whole fish. in order to see if they warrant their present rating.","271":"Update one year on! Christmas Day Mala was crazy busy with a wait of about an hour for a table of two but even so, the staff were friendly and we were geared up for the wait so didn't really mind.\nThe food was so worth it, yet again. Our dishes were rather salty in my previous review but this time they were bang on point with not a hint of over-saltiness.\n\nDishes we had:\nMala Tofu with beef - 4.5\/5\nHot and sour tofu soup - 4\/5\nCumin Beef - 4.5\/5\nDumplings with red oil - 5\/5\nBak Choi with garlic - 5\/5\nEggplant- 4\/5\n\nBeef was in all cases tender and flavourful, the hit and four tofu soup gave us that Sichuan pepper tingly tongue with a lot of toastiness (the textures in this dish are sublime!).\n\nIf our tongues got a bit too tingly the bak Choi was a welcome refresher to hit the reset button!\n\nChristmas Day at Mala is great fun and even better food but please do go with the intent of waiting a long while  for a table and give the staff respect for the craziness of their day!","272":"This place serves pretty solid Sichuan style cuisines. But I will have to agree with some reviews that most of the dishes are salty as hell! Came here with my mom and pops and we all ate around 4-5 bowls of rice trying to balance out the saltiness. The dishes are pretty oily too. So if you're not into a little oil or salt, you might want to heed my warning and stay away. The flavors are bold and pungent. After a while, everything became a little overwhelming and heavy because of the oil and salt overload. Towards the end, every dish started to taste the same. I'm convinced they cook everything with the same chili oil sauce. I ordered a few of the staples that everyone seems to rave about.\n\nChili Oil Wonton 4\/5: Pretty good. Came out piping out. Chili oil is a bit on the sweeter side. Very oily if you're into that.\nWater boiled fish 5\/5: Best dish out of all the dishes, not too salty and fish was nice and flaky. Not overcooked.\nWater Spinach 5\/5: Pretty standard. Cooked the way every other Chinese restaurant cooks it, albeit spicier.\nDan Dan Noodles 3\/5: This was just okay IMO. Cheap, but portions are huge. The sauce tastes very similar to the sauce in the wonton dish.\nSpicy and Crispy Chicken 5\/5: Love the flavor of this dish! You can really taste all the spices. The chicken is diced into tiny pieces and then fried\/stir fried with a shit ton of red chili.\n\nWould I venture out here again and risk having my car hit since Mala is located in the heart of Chinatown? Probably. My curiosity is peaked and I'm excited to see what their other dishes taste like.","273":"Next to Northeastern Chinese food, Sichuan has to be my next favorite. If the only type of Chinese food that you have tried is the China Wok III down at the strip mall, then you're really, really missing out. The thing I love about Sichuan food is that it isn't afraid of strong, bold flavors  unlike some other regions of China, such as Guangzhou.\n\nWe ordered a few classic dishes, such as the water-boiled beef, lion's head meatballs, hot-oil wonton's, and twice-cooked pork belly. The water-boiled beef was quite good, although it played it a bit safe by not using as many Sichuan Peppercorns (the little numbing things) as other Sichuan restaurants I've had. One thing that I don't like about Sichuan food is that they tend to use too much salt in their cooking, but MaLa seasoned all of their dishes perfectly. The twice-cooked pork was also excellent, and the pork was cooked properly where the fat from the belly has been drained.\n\nHowever, the other dishes we had were a bit of a miss. The Lion's head meatballs, although traditionally a Huaiyang dish, were completely pink and undercooked in the center. I talked to the server about this, but she had assured us that there was nothing wrong with it. We decided to wing it and try the meatballs, but it really did just taste like slightly warm raw meat without any seasoning. The hot-oil wonton's were decent, but the dough tasted frozen and bought in and the filling was the size of a pea.\n\nOverall, I would come back, but try some other dishes. It seems that Ma La wants to cater more to the masses, but it may harm them by straying too far away from tradition. Any further, and they'll turn into a PF Changs.","274":"I think this location is better than its counterpart.\nIf you're just recently easing yourself into Szechuan food, feel free to try the mapo tofu, dan dan, dumplings, and kungpao chicken or crispy beef; you can't go wrong with these items, and they're all very flavorful.\n\nBe mindful of the potent pepper(s) that tingle your tongue, but after you get used to Szechuan food, you won't notice it as much. Just de-sensitize yourself to it. It took me about a couple visits to get used to it.","275":"This has to be one of the best Chinese food I've had. I don't eat it too often, but I'm very glad we came here. We had bacon wrapped garlic and dumplings and those were amazing. We had kon Pao chicken, and the lion head dish (meatballs); the chicken was a little spicy but really tasty I didn't love the peppercorns numbing my mouth, but the meatballs were delightful. Big portions, and the service was decent. Overall a pleasant experience.","276":"Ate here today with a bunch of girl friends so we got a variety of dishes and all of them were very tasty. My favorites were the Crispy Chicken, I could have eaten the whole plate, and the Cumin Beef. The Water boiled fish was also really good and had a beautifully fluffy texture to the fish.  We also ordered the Dan Dan Noodles, Red Oil Dumplings, Wontons, Fried Rice, and Chicken Chow Mein. All very good but I wouldn't stab anyone with my fork for the last bite like I would for the crispy chicken or cumin beef. \n  \nAfter the meal out waiter recommended dessert. We split what seemed to be layers or crepe with a coconut cream drizzled with a caramel sauce on top. It was really good and worth saving a little room for.  \n\nAll in all a very good restaurant with great service. I would defiantly stop in again when in the area.","277":"I think my expectations may have been a bit too high having heard that Mala Sichuan Bistro is the best Chinese restaurant in all of Houston, but I was not disappointed. It was my first time trying Sichuan cuisine, so I appreciated the detailed English descriptions on the menus. We ordered several entrees to share a la family style, and by mid-way through our meal our nostrils were blazing and tongues content by all of the rich spices. My favorite dish was Mala's version of Mapo tofu - vegetarian and with thicker slices of tofu.\n\nMy only gripe would have to be with the amount of oil and salt present in many of the dishes. I understand that these may be the costs of delicious, spicy Sichuan cuisine, but it's probably not the healthiest of options. All in all, Mala's food is delicious and unique, and I will be coming in again.","278":"Drove pass this place, gave a try. We were asked if we would mind sitting with others if not it would be 20 minutes wait. After 10 minutes wait, we decided to sit with others. We ordered spicy and crispy chicken, tofu delights and crabs soup. The first two were very disappointing (chicken was too sweet and tofu wasn't fresh) as for crab soup, it was so so. Upon checking out, the waitress looked at my tip and appeared unhappy. She demanded 10% tip claiming its minimum. She had the nerves to ask me if I am not happy with food or services, feel free to inform them. I responded, I would definitely tell them. I left this place and won't look back. This is unbelievable! If you like Sichuan food, try Chuan's on Fountainview and Westheimer. They are much better. I looked into the feedback trails for Mala Sichuan Bistro other diners had the same issue regarding tip demands. This is a repeated undesired behavior. If you want good tips? Just provide good food and service, that's easy. I have never known this place before and don't want to ever dine here ever again.","279":"I come here all the time!!!\nservice 4\/5\nfood    5\/5  (a bit salty otherwise it's great)\nDeep Fried chicken with hot pepper and water boiled fish are must try.\nCumin Lamb is great if you like lamb.\n\nHere are the down sides:\nBathroom is too dirty and it's hard to find parking during lunch hour.","280":"Finally found my go to spot in Houston for authentic Chinese food !    We ordered the Spicy and Fried Chicken, Pepper Steak and original wonton soup.  The jasmine tea was all natural...not from a tea bag!   The price was great and the serving size was generous.","281":"We came here to try a popular dish - dan dan noodles, introduced to us by a youtuber \"Food Ranger\". We were so hyped after weeks of watching him exploring Sichuan foods. I think the flavors were decent, but we did not like the numbing effect of the peppercorn.","282":"An oldie but a goodie, Mala is simply some of the best Chinese in Houston. While there have been quite a few Szechuan places popping up in much trendier neighborhoods lately, Mala is where you go for quality, value, and good old Chinatown authenticity. Yes, I know there Cooking Girl or even Mala near River Oaks that are pretty good too, but compared to the original Mala in Chinatown, you're paying extra for a whitewashed bougie experience. \n\nAs a California transplant, I can say that Mala holds it together pretty well compared to places I've been to in SGV and around the SF Bay Area. Come with friends and family and order a lot to share, and you can't go wrong with anything here.","283":"Amazing sichuan food! The hot and sour soup is so soulful with the wood ear mushrooms and bamboo shoots, the hot boiling fish is one of the best I have ever had in sichuan restaurants and the mapo tofu and Dan Dan noodles are a superhit. The crispy spicy sesame chicken makes for a nice balanced appetizer with its crispy crunchy texture and heat which is not over the top. Don't get scared of the red chillies they throw on top, it's not fiery hot. My husband likes the eggplant dish while I like the simple spinach with garlic seasoning to balance all the heat.\nYes, we order all of this for 2 of us and take leftovers to go esp the soup as its a lot to finish but sooo yumm!\nWe leave this place with a numb tongue (Thanks to sichuan peppers- a happy tantalizing numb) and a warm heart and a burp!\nOne of my favorite places in Chinatown for sure :)","284":"Came here before dinner rush hour on a holiday. We had high expectations for this place since we've been to its sister restaurant on montrose and loved it.\n\nUnfortunately our experience was least than satisfactory. I should have caught the red flag when our server came over and asked us what we wanted to order. His tone of voice was close to irritable. Like we were the one giving him a hard time. When asked which veggie dish he recommended he pointed at 2 while muttering something about them. So unenthusiastic. We shrugged it off ofc. Our 2 dishes came out and ofc the food was great. We had our usual water boiled fish and tried the crispy mala beef. We had a third dish, mapo tofu, but it never came to us. When reminded they said they will go and checked. Never got back to us. By the time we finish most of our food, we hailed down our first server  and told him we didn't want our mapo tofu anymore since there's no point, we were done. He got on his walkie and asked for it and another server told him it was coming out. We adamantly told him it's okay we are done. He screamed into his walkie saying something in Chinese and the same server screamed the same message to the kitchen. I understand the restaurant became very busy toward the end of our meal but people who came in after us have gotten all their dishes and we were still waiting. We paid and left.\n\nFood wise the food is great. Service wise this place really need to work on their attitude. They should know that customer see everything on their faces. The female server look like she wanted to kill us when told we didn't want our last dish anymore. Not to mention she put the wrong dish on our table and rushed to another table. Like wtf, you have one job. I would recommend the other location for same good food but way better service.","285":"Excellent tonight. Water boiled beef, Cumin Beef, Mala Beef Tendon and Mala Bamboo.  \nAnother home run dinner at Mala.","286":"Yeah come here, Its actually authentic. The spice is real and you cannot deny it. The one thing I recommend is the food would stay cold thats all. But yes its the real deal guys. Go head try something spicy you won't be disappointed.","287":"Current staple in our dinner rotation. My must eats changed slightly.. now:\n\n*Crispy Spicy Chicken\n*Mala Crispy Beef\n*Eggplant with Spicy Garlic Sauce\n*Water Boiled Fish\n\nThey still give 5% discount for cash. This is by far the best sichuan style Chinese food in Houston. Service is pretty good for Chinatown. They're pretty attentive and make sure your water\/tea is always full. \n\nTaking the crispy mala beef\/crispy chicken to go is never the same b\/c it's never as crispy as in the restaurant.","288":"This is probably the best Szechuan restaurant in Houston. They have 2 locations, this one on Bellaire and one on Westheimer in Montrose. Between the 2 locations, I've come to prefer this one more for the following reasons:\n- Flavor is more authentic here, the Montrose location is more catered to non-Asians\n- Portions are slightly larger here\n- Prices are slightly cheaper here, probably because of rent being cheaper and the Chinatown crowd\n\nMy go to dishes are:\n- Water boiled fish: comes with plenty pieces of fish and a good balance of veggies at the bottom (5\/5)\n- Crispy spicy chicken: flavoring is so good! Try to avoid the little peppercorns (unless you like it), if you don't want to explore a dish that's too crazy this is probably the way to go (5\/5)\n- Mapo tofu: they don't have the option of adding pork at this location, which is fine because it's just as delicious with or without it, in terms of flavor it's similar to the water boiled fish, the tofu is super soft (5\/5)","289":"Waited almost 40 minutes for a table at 7pm! Should have come a little earlier because it is so popular! Hot sour soup was great! Pork fried noodles and kun Pau chicken very good! Prices are very reasonable! Very satisfying! Will probably come back again in the future!","290":"I feel that I'm fairly picky when it comes to Chinese cuisine, but one of my close friend's recommended this place to me on Christmas day. It reminded me of my grandma's food.\nThe food here is spicy, salty, sweet and comes out piping hot. I recommend getting the crispy chicken and mala tofu dishes if you enjoy salty\/spicy flavors.","291":"Really amazing dinner with family here. We went to Chinatown with the idea of wanting to try a new place since my mom has a habit of eating in the same places all the time. \n\nI remembered that I ate at the Montrose location and liked most of the items I ordered and have been meaning to try the original location. We thought either there or Yummy Kitchen next door. But when we got there we realized that Yummy Kitchen was no longer Taiwanese food and was a hot pot buffet instead. Um....we will pass. You really need to be in the mood for that. \n\nSo we went to Mala instead. We ordered the eggplant in spicy garlic, tea infused duck, steamed tilapia, dan dan noodles, red oil dumplings, and salt and pepper prawns. Yum!!! Everything was so good. There was nothing left over for 4 people who do not usually have the ability to clean a plate up. LOL...... \n\nI didn't realize until afterwards that I only took pictures of the dumplings. I was to entwined in the food and was so hungry. Sorry guys....I really suggest you try this place out. Amazing!!!!","292":"This was my fourth time at Mala Sichuan in six months. I got my vegetarian staples: mapo tofu, Chengdu mung bean noodles, and the chilled cucumber. The total price was under $20, and could have fed three or more people. Oh, and it was so tasty. The mapo tofu could be as spicy as the mung bean noodles and use a bit more Sichuan peppercorn, but don't get me wrong: I'm just nitpicking at this point. The mung bean noodles remind me of home. The cucumber dish really balances out the other spicy food.\n\nI once brought my mom - someone who was born and raised in Sichuan - to try the food, and she loved it. Sometimes I think I should try other restaurants in Houston's Chinatown on Bellaire, but with stellar food at rock bottom prices, I have yet to do that aside from FuFu's, which was only because I wanted food after Mala was closed!","293":"I finally got to try this place out after months of my Chinese friends telling me that this was \"the best restaurant in Chinatown,\" and too be completely honest, while it wasn't the best asian food I've ever had, it was definitely the best Sichuan I've had in Houston. The food is relatively cheap, but the amount of food you get per dish is relatively low compared to other restaurants in the area. The place itself was relatively full of customers (mostly families and college students), and the decor was typical of asian restaurants. Our server was very polite and kept checking up on us throughout. The only hitch was that they forgot one of our dishes, but by the time we noticed, our server remembered and actually checked up on it for us without us even having to say anything.\n\nNow it's time for the food. We had deep fried green beans, beef tendon and eggplant. The deep fried green beans had bits of ground beef and were nice and crunchy. They had a hint of spiciness that wasn't overpowering and gave the dish flavor. I only wish that there were more meat to go with the veggies. The beef tendon had good texture, but the heat that I was getting from it was strange. While it kept increasing in spiciness with each bite, it was a strange spice flavor that both my friends and myself weren't used to, and I think all of us agreed to not order it ever again. Finally, the eggplant was well cooked with a slightly spicy kick. The sauce was really good and really made the dish. It wasn't too spicy but it had a ton of flavor. Definitely my favorite dish of the three. \n\nAll in all, while it has its short comings, Mala is definitely one of the best asian restaurants in Houston. I definitely will be coming back.","294":"Things to Know:\nA majority of the food here is spicy! Get ready to sweat. There are some non-spicy foods but for me, the spicier the better.\n\nFood: 5 Stars\nI come here often and I always try at least one new dish. All the dishes I have tried have been really good!! TRUST. Below are some dishes I recommend.\n\n- Garlic Bacon: Just try it.\n- Red Oil Dumplings: I have to get this every time I go. HAVE TO.\n- Dan Dan Noodles: My boyfriend loves this one. It's a small bowl, so if you don't like sharing, then get two.\n- Water Boiled Fish: If I would've known that boiling fish can be this good, I would boil fish everyday.\n- Twice Cooked Pork: I mean, cooking pork once is good, but this is cooked twice! Even better.\n- Crispy Chicken: My only qualm about this dish is that the chicken to pepper ratio sucks. There's more pepper than chicken (at least the last time I ordered it).\n- Mala Beef Tendon: Skeptical at first because it was a cold dish, still ended up tasting really good.\n- Mapo Tofu: Still good even though there's no meat in it.\n- Mala Beef Tofu: Similar to Mapo Tofu but with minced beef.\n- Sweet and Sour Crispy Tilapia: Like sweet and sour chicken but with fried Tilapia!\n\nService: 4 Stars\nThey take your order, they fill your drinks. I come here for the food, not the service. But service isn't bad.\n\nmadgouda.wordpress.com","295":"We've been to this place so many times but I'm just getting around to writing a review now! I've been to China a couple of times and to the province that serves thise kind of spice. This restaurant is the closest I've found in Houston to having that authentic taste! I have legit brought so many of my friends here.\n\nWe always start with the Couples Tongue Slices and dumpling dishes. If we have a lot of people, we order a fish stew as well. If not, we love the cumin beef and you cannot go wrong with the Dam Dam noodles and the sour and spicy noodles!\n\nThe service here is okay. All of the wait staff communicate on earpieces so they can ensure that everyone receives service when they need it. The food usually comes out in a timely manner. Unfortunately, this time we ordered a dumpling dish and we had to ask 3 times for it. The last time, I asked for it to be taken off the order because we were finished eating and they finally brought the dish out. Also, they're not always the most welcoming. Sometimes there are smiles and sometimes they look super serious and won't smile when talking or interacting with you.\n\nThe decor is okay as well but the food makes up for it. Definitely come for the food!","296":"I am a huge fan of spicy food, especially Sichuan food, so I eat a lot of it. I heard a lot of my friends raving about Mala, and I finally had the opportunity to go with a large group of friends. We got a private room (which has a minimum of $150 purchase of food). We thought it would be easy to hit that minimum, but it actually was pretty difficult. The food here is surprisingly cheap! Most of the dishes I wanted, like Dan Dan Noodles and Red Oil Dumplings, ranged at about $5. Thus, we ended up taking a lot of untouched food home because we ordered seconds and fourths of certain dishes.\n\nOverall, I want to give Mala a 3.5. The food was pretty good, but it was all very, very salty and not as spicy as other Sichuan places. I felt like they were catering a lot towards American tastebuds and not staying true to the more traditional Sichuan tastes. However, the food was still good, and I am giving it 4 stars for quickness, efficient staff, and decent prices. Now, for a breakdown of food.\n\nDan Dan Noodles: Good, but not better than QQ Noodle House in Dun Huang. \n\nRed Oil Dumplings&Wontons: Great! These were my favorite of the night. Their dumplings are a lot larger than you would expect, and the dish was excellent.\n\nEggplants (Garlic&Spicy version): These were also pretty good. The eggplants were cooked well, not too mushy, but like most of their dishes, it seemed to be slathered in oil and salt.\n\nMussels: One bite and I was done. It was like I ate a spoonful of salt.\n\nRabbit: Interesting. I've never had rabbit before, and the taste was pretty good. But it seemed to be rabbit tendon? So there was a lot of cartilage in the meat pieces. Beware.\n\nPrawns: Nothing too special.\n\nKung Pao Chicken: Surprisingly delicious. Different than other versions, with a touch of spicy.\n\nCabbage: A nice contrast to all of the oily food and made with a lot of peppercorn.\n\nCucumber sticks: Really good and refreshing! It's hard to mess these up.\n\nCumin beef: not my favorite dish. Definitely spicier than the other dishes, but the beef was a bit dry.\n\nCrab and asparagus soup: Very, very, very bland.\n\nTofu Delight: Slathered in too much sauce that takes away from the tofu.","297":"Does Mala Sichuan Bistro serve good food? Absolutely. Does it deserve four stars? Possibly. But not today.\n\nMy son and I came here mid-afternoon and decided that we would order a smorgasbord -- based mainly on online photos and reviews. We were seated promptly in the bright dining room by a very polite hostess. Our server (actually there were 2-3 of them) was spot on in getting our orders correct. But they were either at the table every 3-4 minutes, or AWOL for 15 minutes. At least we were entertained during the lulls by a country music soundtrack. Strange and unexpected for sure.\n\nLike I said, we ordered a bunch for sampling -- Couples Lung Slices (no lung, but plenty of beef tendon and tripe) was a consistency-lovers dream. Thinly sliced meats (that usually find their way into sausage mixes here in America) are tossed in a slightly spicy oil. Same thing with the Mala Beef Tendon. Both are served chilled. We enjoyed the dishes, but much in the same way that I enjoyed lime-flavored beer: one bottle is enough (for a lifetime). The Red Oil Dumplings, which seem to be the calling card for this place, are exactly as the name describes: oily as hell. Still, the balance of sweet, salty and spice were enough to make me want another ... and another. The Hot & Sour Soup was just OK. The stock used to make it was obviously not very rich and I tasted very little white pepper (if any) and nary a tang of vinegar. Oh well.\n\nWe also sampled three entrees (hey, I told you we ordered a bunch). First, the Water Boiled Fish Fillet. This is an interesting dish with a slew of fun flavors. The fish, as was likely intended, was way on the soft side. While this dish was probably well executed, I couldn't figure out whether or not I cared for the consistency. I think firmer fish would make for a more toothsome dish, but it's not my restaurant and I'm not the chef. (And my rating is not affected by this dish one way or the other.) ~ The Mala Pot Roasted Prawns get mixed reviews from me. First, the spicy flavor is outstanding. I mean -- really good. But why in the hell would you season a piece of shrimp while it's still in the shell? I cannot enjoy said seasoning and much of that wonderful spice mixture is lost. Furthermore. in an appetizer I can understand serving up shrimp in the shell, but you have to remember that this is served on a bed of (cooked) peppers and celery. It ain't exactly finger food. ~ Finally, the Eggplants in Spicy Garlic Sauce were some of the best I've had in a very long time. The sweet pungent eggplant and fiery garlic sauce were the perfect balance.\n\nIf the eggplant was the only thing I ordered, this place would get five stars, which is rare for me. If I ordered eggplant and the Red Oil Dumplings, it would get four stars. But we had to go order a ton of other stuff that was either pretty good (the cold appetizers), interesting but underwhelming (the boiled fish), blah (hot & sour soup) and slightly frustrating (prawns). For what it's worth, our dishes were not over-salted. In fact, the soup was lacking some depth and could have used some soy sauce.  \n\nAll in all, a good -- but not great -- Chinese food experience. Today, anyway.","298":"A solid experience nothing americanized about this unique spicy experience.  Order more than you think you need to try the different  flavors.","299":"Mala has received many accolades from local and national sources, and for good reason.  A small group of us came here on a weeknight during the holidays and it was packed.  Ive never seen so many white people at a chinatown restaurant in my life!!  Aside from all that, we were able to snag a table faster than others based on our group size.  Mala is one of my favorite places to eat at in Houston and get my spicy food fix.  You cant go wrong with the Dan Dan noodles,  spicy crispy chicken, baby pepper black bean beef, sauted spinach with garlic, or mala pot roasted tilapia.  The spicy dishes are the chicken and the beef in that order.  I also like the red oil rabbit and cold noodles.\n\nEven though it was busy, service was remarkable and everyone seemed to enjoy the food.  Prices here are excellent as well...you really can't go wrong with any dish on the menu.  After the 5% discount, our bill was only $55 for a party of 4 with leftovers to take home.","300":"Mala Sichuan Bistro is the most overrated Sichuan restaurant in town, period. For a hardcore food lover born and raised in Chengdu, Sichuan, this place is weird. The decor and menu both look authentic enough but the taste of all the staples is just so wrong. I suspect that they purposely adapted them for the acceptance from a wider range of customer. Nonetheless, they failed me on all of the classic Chengdu\/Sichuan dishes, cold and hot.\n\nIf you like the taste of real Sichuan food, Chuan's Chinese restaurant and Chengdu Taste are probably the best places to go in Houston as they both have a few decent options on the menu that resembles the food in its origin. For Chinese food in general, Pepper Twin is the place I visited most frequently-- they have a mix of spicy and non spicy dishes that all taste like normal Chinese food rather than some weird adapted versions. (For real, Pepper Twin's famous Mr. & Ms. Smith is so darn delicious, even better when reheated in microwave if you have leftover or ordered extra to go as I often do.)","301":"Whenever we feel like eating steamed fish in an Asian restaurant, Mala Sichuan cooked the way we love it most.  It garnishes with lots of green onion with ginger, and the tasty soy sauce that I could mixed with rice, it's so flavorful.  Our favorites also include salt chilly chicken nuggets and the fried eggs soup in our regular order, delicious!  Servers are friendly and great in services.  Like viewing the collection of plates with different designs that are pinned as wall decor, nice!","302":"Mala Sichuan Bistro is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. I eat there at least once a month to satisfy my crave for authentic Sichuan cuisine. \n\nAt lunch, I normally chose the stewed tofu, spiced dried tofu with pork and shrimp fried rice. Once awhile, I order the Sichuan's famous tea smoked duck and \"ants climbing a tree\" (mung bean noodle with minced pork). However, I stay away from the sweet tofu desert.\n\nThe best part about this restaurant is the consistency of the flavor throughout the day. There is no difference between lunches and dinners.","303":"If you are up for the searing burn of Sichuan dried chilies along with the tongue numbing delightfully disorienting and aromatic Sichuan peppercorn, then please visit this place.\n\nThis is hands down the best Sichuan food in Houston, I am a foodie and this place satisfy my palate. Extremely flavorful food, especially their Lamb in cumin, spicy and crispy chicken and whole fish in sauces are delight. A must go place in Houston.","304":"One of my fav places to eat in Houston. Okay, maybe it's my absolute fav place to eat. Mala is a crowd pleaser, always, and a good place to take out-of-towners to show off how amazing Chinatown in Houston is. \n\nOur go-to dishes:\nCrispy spice chicken\nWater boiled fish\nFish filet and sauerkraut soup\nSatueed bokchoy or water spinach with garlic and chili\n\nTry them with a bottle of vouvray on their wine list and you got yourself an awesome meal.","305":"Have tried cumin lamb , fried rice and kungpao chicken. Everything tasted great . If you like the numbness of the peppers it's a great place , if you don't like that flavor skip this place .","306":"THE STORY OF WHY MALA & I ARE ON A BREAK: Mannn so disappointed it got to be like this; I saw it coming too, & I guess I'm sorry I didn't stop it. However, it's you, Mala Sichuan, not me. I was good to you and recommended you to others. Took others to try you. You did your part with that delicious spicy crispy chicken. I saw pass the slight saltiness of the cumin beef. I wasn't even salty about that. I raved about you, then your waitress got to kill our bond. I had put my cash in the folder with the bill ($30 cash for a $24 something bill). My friend had placed $3 cash tip on the table. I saw the waitress grab the $3 and the folder. I could see I was about to get played, but I didn't say anything because I didn't want to assume the worst. Anyways, I got my change back ($5 something back; I made sure it was exactly that, too), so I assume the waitress just kept the tip, which is fine, UNTIL we left the place and she accused me of not tipping. UM WHAT happen to the $3 my friend put down that you took with the bill folder. That's why you had nothing to say when I called you out, but I was there to enjoy time with my friend so I just gave her another $3 and left. You triflin' waitress for $3 too; guess the hustle is real out here but have some dignity, woman, or should I say girl cause you acting childish.\n\nAnyways, now I'm salty, so we need a break Mala Sichuan.","307":"Went in on Saturday with some friends. We ordered Spicy crispy beef, kung pao chicken, and sauteed spinach. The Kung pao chicken was so so. The flavor was ok but the chicken pieces were fairly mushy with breading soaked in sauce. The Spicy crispy beef was good but did have an overpowering aftertaste. The service was fairly good, as drinks went empty they were generally quick to refill them. It did get strange when we went to pay, the restaurant refused to let everyone pay. Only 2 cards can be used per table they said, no matter how many people are at the table. They refused to break up the check or void the transaction and give us individual checks. It's never good business when you make it difficult for people to give you money.","308":"Much better than its sister company in Montrose.  I like the dan dan mien (not too peanutty like places around town).  Eggplant in garlic sauce.  Spicy and crispy chicken.   Mung bean appetizer.  Tilapia good too.  I've also tried the pork intestine soup and belt fish appetizer.  Both not bad. Red oil dumplings were so so. Not like the ones I ate in Sichuan.  5% discount for cash.  50% eggs when I've been.  Waiters can speak English.  Closed between lunch and dinner like the Montrose store.","309":"Pros:\n-fast service! We got our food in seconds\n-they offer fresh fish \n-for four people, we ordered sweet and sour crispy fish, water spinach with garlic, and Mongolian beef. All great dishes! \n\nCons: \n-I wish they offered fried fish fillets \n-I expected the dishes to be a little bit bigger. My husband and sister could have eaten more!","310":"My colleagues and I usually go to Sichuan Queen for Friday lunches, but it has been lacking since a recent change in ownership, so we decided to check out Mala. I was not disappointed. \nWe walked in and it was packed, but we were seated immediately with another group of people around a large table. Our drink orders were taken right away, and delivered promptly. We ordered Water Boiled Fish Filet, Mapa Tofu, Spicy and Crispy Chicken, and Dan Dan Noodles. The Dan Dan order wasn't entered, but it worked out for the best since there was already plenty of food for the two of us. \nWe were served rice along with all the dishes around the same time. The Chicken was amazing - great flavor and plenty of spice. \nI highly recommend for small or large groups. We have definitely found our new Friday lunch spot!","311":"Came here with 3 other friends to celebrate our friend's birthday! Birthday boy is actually from the Sichuan region in China and he said this was his favorite restaurant in Houston because it reminds him of home. \n\nWe ordered spicy crispy chicken, mongolian beef, saut\u00e9ed water spinach, and tea smoked duck. Spicy crispy chicken had little red peppers that gave a kick! Mongolian beef was pretty good but nothing that stood out about it. I really enjoyed saut\u00e9ed water spinach as it was cooked just right and the flavor was not too salty and not too bland. I liked the garlic pieces in them. Tea smoked duck took a while for it to come out. We were pretty much done with the other dishes by the time the duck came out. The tasye was a bit bland and the meat was rough. I probably wouldn't order it next time. I would def like to come back here to try other dishes!","312":"Loved the water boiled fish filet and Dan Dan noodles! Service was top notch in Chinese restaurants. Food is inexpensive too. Definitely one of my go to places for spicy authentic Chinese food","313":"Authentic Sichuan Food. Spicy delicious goodness. Service is fast and efficient. Pay in cash to get a small discount. \n\nMake sure to check out the bakery nextdoor. Hong Kong style pasteries.","314":"Solid Sichuan fare with a well thought out menu catering to the pepper loving crowd, which I'm happy to say I am one of.  However, they also have some Non-Hot dishes that will appease the more sensitive palate, so have no fear of bringing the non spice eaters here as well.  I have always been served promptly and treated well here, so I don't know what some of the other reviewer's are speaking about, but then again I always go during off hours during the week.\n\nI gave only three stars since I have not found that one dish I can't live without - now don't get me wrong, this is a good restaurant, but we our fortunate to have MANY good restaurants in Houston.  Point in fact, just two doors down you can find a solid competitor that in many instances have dishes that meet or excel Mala's, so if Mala is overflowing as it sometimes does, well you have options.\n\nTake as many people as you can, order as many different dishes as you can and enjoy.  It's worth a trip.","315":"Omg! This place is so good! Must get the red oil handmade wontons and the curry beef! The sauce of the wontons is so good! A little savory, slightly tangy, mildly sweet, and very flavorful! Dan Dan noodles were good but you should add the red wonton oil to the Dan Dan noodles and it's even better!","316":"Really fun group dinner at Mala Sichuan last weekend. My friend arranged the evening and we were able to get a small private room for the 7 of us. I don't know that I can recall everything we ordered nor do I remember the names of the dishes I do recall, but most of it was very tasty. I especially liked the crispy chicken, noodles, and the tofu. \n\nService was attentive and the wine list was surprisingly sophisticated. We had some cider and riesling that complemented the spice well. \n\nThe only bummer was they only take 2 credit cards per party, so with 7 of us it was a struggle to pay.","317":"It has been said that you are what you eat. I must be an asshole then, because Mala has turned me into a pork intestine loving fool. Num num num.\n\nThe intestine jokes will come later. To start, the Garlic Bacon is one of the weirdest, tastiest appetizers I've had at a Chinese restaurant. It defies everything I know about bacon. The appetizer is cold (strike 1), with room temperature bacon in the middle (what?), and wrapped in cucumber (uhh...), doused in a sweet garlic sauce - and somehow it all works together. Another dish to dish about is the Spicy Crispy Chicken. As the name implies, it's spicy. It's crispy. It's chicken. What the name doesn't explain is how damn addicting it is, like the Chinese take on popcorn chicken.\n\nThe Crunchy Pork Intestine is ASStounding. Seriously, it's the shit (no actual shit included). Mala takes fried pork intestines to another level by not only serving them with the proper amount of crunch, but by also seasoning them up with an ASSertive spice, making this one unique trip down the digestive tract! Mala Sichuan Bistro is the ambASSador of fried pork intestines. Even my picky boyfriend was able to toss this leafless salad!\n\nNo dish lacked in packing flavor and spice. The food is simple and well done. Sorry if this review made me seem ASS-inine, but you would be a total butt head not to come and try Mala Sichuan Bistro, even if you're not quite ready to be a butt-munch just yet.","318":"I must say that before having Chinese food at this place, I had the most unfulfilling experiences at Chinese restaurants that I quit going to them. This place has renewed my faith in Chinese food. Mala Sichuan has had the best and most authentic Chinese food I have ever had in Texas. A hidden gem, Mala Sichuan is located in the Chinatown area of Houston. I ordered various chicken dishes each time and they never disappoint. The dishes are flavorful, plentiful, and full of spice. If you ask for spicy, you get spicy! Not to mention the prices are not bad at all. I definitely will keep coming back to this place as my go-to Chinese restaurant. A must try!!","319":"Wow!  I had never had a true Sichuan cuisine, and I was astonished at how delicious this was.  We had the chile eggplant as the boiled fish-don't be alarmed by the unappealing titles! The fish was particularly exquisite-I can't recommend the fish enough.  The seasoning is spicy yet refined, leaving an amazing subtle aftertaste of spiciness.  The dessert cakes have a 10-15 layer crepe cake-the caramel sauce was delicious, though the matcha cake was less amazing than the chocolate.  The servers were friendly and quick, though sometimes confused by our questions about the menu.","320":"I can see why Mala is so acclaimed within the Houston community. I can't believe it took me so long to pay Mala a visit! We ordered some of the most recommended dishes: the red oil dumplings, Dan Dan noodles, and spicy crispy chicken. 5\/5 for everything! Flavorful, spicy, and plentiful servings. I left with a full belly and a tingling tongue. Will be back!","321":"This place was so good and authentic, \nI recommend this place if you've never had sichuan food but you're interested in trying something new.\nGood for a cold winter day, the food will warm you up. \nIf you aren't used to spicy food, you might want to bring your own cold water and paper towels. Eating here will make you sweat","322":"This place was excellent !! We had meetings up the beltway and stopped in Chinatown for lunch prior, great food and very unique. Service was on point, nice business crowd in there for lunch. Authentic Chinese but a little more focused on Western crowd who may not be adventurous to try some of the other more ethnic mom and pop places on Bellaire. Menu was well rounded enough to offer both foodies and those with more conservative constitutions an enjoyable experience.","323":"It's a busy, hectic and the our dishes didn't come out at the same time, in fact one came out when we had finished eating. However, they have delicious, flavorful food. We were overwhelmed by the menu due to the quantity of different dishes, so don't rush to order. Really peruse the menu. Everyone has different preferences: veggies only, seafood and veggies, meat with more meat. The biggest hit at the table was the shrimp with asparagus, tender and fresh.  \n\nI recommend Mala to anyone wanting to try Sichuan style dishes at affordable prices.","324":"Don't get the hype.  Food was average at best.  Service was slow.  Ambience was zero.  Meh...","325":"I went here yesterday and was hoping for the best chinese food in bellaire... My friend, who is in the industry  said it was the best for him.... Its located on the older side of Chinatown..  So the building is old.  I came here at 6:20pm , on a wednesday..  When you walk in , its kind of tight.    The staff barely speaks English. So there could be a problem.. Just read the yelp reviews for ordering options, then...  I ordered the cummin beef, spicy chicken, and water  boiled fish filet.    It took about 20 minutes for the food with half the restaurant filled.  The cummin beef was kind of weird , i never tasted this type of dish beef...  People on yelp , do say they like this dish, but for me the taste was more exotic to my taste bud... I would avoid this dish...  The water boiled fish filet was more on the greasy side, and not agreeing with my taste bud.... The spicy chicken\nwas the best dish of the 3 .   It was a solid choice... Maybe next time I will try other items.... Maybe the next items I will try will be better.","326":"This place is hands-down the very best Chinese food that I've eaten in Houston. I ate lunch there today with my teenage boys. We LOVED it!  On the menu today:\n\nSpicy Crispy Chicken. Oh Dear. Everyone who walks through the door of Mala should immediately just say this.  \"How many in your party?\"  SPICY CRISPY CHICKEN.  They will eventually bring some, which you will eat, and then you too will know what food is served in the afterlife. It's this stuff.\n\nCumin Lamb. Man. Good stuff. Wow. Also comes in beef, equally crazy, insane, gotta-have-it.\n\nMongolian Beef. Not the heavy sauce stuff you get other places.  It's good, traditional food done right.\n\nShredded Pork with Garlic Sauce.  Lovely. Other stuff better, this stuff still pretty tasty.\n\nI'll sum it up. Go here. Get food. Eat it. Go home.  Repeat.","327":"This place is absolutely delicious, customer services great and the environment very relax","328":"It was a nice Sichuan food restaurant with authentic food. But after they opened new location in Montrose. They longer keep the quality.","329":"I'm going to be honest with you: I'm not too adventurous when it comes to Asian food. I prefer very Americanized varieties. I don't want to be like this; I just am. So, as a disclaimer, I will say that if you too are easily freaked out by authentic cuisines, you may not want to dine here (or at least don't look at the menu too closely). \n\nWith that said, I will now say that this a very good restaurant. Clean, pretty, friendly staff, nicely presented dishes, and good prices. My group ordered several different things to share and everyone really enjoyed it. The Cumin Beef is very good and everyone loves the Dan Dan Noodles.\n\nWill I go here again? Mostly likely not, but everyone else I've talked to loves it, so I'm going to say it's objectively good and I'm just a weirdo.","330":"Not bad. Not good. Might be me. The Spicy Dy Chicken -- it was really really dry. Like crazy dry. \nI don't know how people choke it down. I know I know it's supposed to be dry. This was not for me. \n\nThe hot and sour soup -- I like it that it was piping hot and it was ok until I got a piece of ginger or something that tasted like garbage and it soured everything else.\nMaybe I will try their noodle soup. \nIt's an easy place to get in and out of and its a nice interior. Expensive tho.","331":"We, Japanese, call this restaurant as Koguma, and all likes here. Good taste, and nice cost performance!!","332":"Mala Sichuan was a bit of a surprise for me; hadn't heard of it until a friend invited me there. They advertise authentic Chinese cuisine and it seems to be accurate, though I've never been to China. Not the Americanized version of Chinese food by any means. Menu is varied enough that you can try some very safe items and some very \"out-there\" items, compared to the typical American palate. I got a spicy dried beef dish, which I would put somewhere in the middle of the road. They also advertise very spicy food, and it definitely delivered. My friend got a fish soup and it was also very good and had a kick to it. Portions are large and prices are very reasonable. It doesn't market as a family-style dining experience, but it definitely is. We ended up sharing and had plenty to spare and took as leftovers (which reheated well). Will definitely be back to try more of the menu (but might smuggle in some milk to soothe my poor mouth!).","333":"Love this place. The dining room isn't that large so there is a chance that a wait for a table may be  inevitable. My family lucked out on the last visit and were quickly seated. Even our picky son tried the food ! Our favorites are the sweet eggplants, baby bok choy, tea duck, and chili oil dumplings. We've tried other dishes and will certainly be back again. Montrose location is more of a night time date spot relative to this one.","334":"First time there. Place busy big line for waiting.\nHot n sour soup good. Boil water fish awesome. Chicken low mein spicy n good. Crispy chickem zero.. Our server Andy was friendly but lacks to understand english. We told him to repeat order ckept shaking his head yeah yeah. One order we had replaced with new one. Still the order came. We told the other gut who got our food that we have cancelles this order still he kept shaking his head.","335":"I usually get the same three things each time I go here and it's all reasonably priced and feels like a lot of food. This place is not for those that can't handle spicy food. I've gone to other Sichuan places and none of them compare\n\nOne draw back is sometimes there is a wait because of how good this place is and they may ask if you want to eat with another group, which you can say no to.","336":"4.25 stars.  When I moved back to the Lone Star State, I certainly wasn't expecting to be treated to better Szechuan food than what I found in DC (and on par with the greatest places in NYC), but after a trip to Houston's Mala Sichuan Bistro and numerous trips to San Antonio's Sichuan House, I am pleasantly surprised with what I'm finding here in Texas.  \n\nThe crowning achievement of the Mala experience arrived in the form of Arctic surf clams basted in a mysterious green sauce.  While I've never had clams served in this manner, I must say they were pleasant to eat.  The water boiled fish filet consisted of soft flounder and vegetables serve in a fiery concoction of spices and chili oil.  Husks of tender purple eggplant were also delightful, and the Szechuan dumplings were also a hit.  \n\nIf you are looking for Szechuan province cuisine, this great restaurant on the outskirts of Houston's Chinatown will certainly meet your needs.  Highly recommended for Houstonians.","337":"This is the real deal (Chinese food). Dined with my daughter's boyfriend who grew up in China and he vouches that the food here is the real deal.\n\nWe ordered a variety of dishes with pork, fish and vegetarian selections. All were simply fantastic and very flavorful.\n\nThe service is good but very busy. Also it is a bit on the noisy side but probably owing to the popularity of the restaurant.\n\nThe bill was a shock - not because it was expensive - but because it was so low. Only one dish that we ordered was over $10 and there were 4 of us. Everyone was full and we left with major portions in doggie bags.\n\nThe area and the parking lot are a bit iffy...don't leave anything in your car that you don't want stolen.\n\nOverall, great food and great value!","338":"As it's listed in the top 20 restaurants of Houston, we had to give it a shot.\nWe're here at least 2x a month, it's AMAZING!\n\nThe must orders are:\n\nSpicy Crispy Chicken - teeny pieces of perfectly spicy\/seasoned chicken tossed with dried peppers, garlic, red oil & cilantro... If you don't want to be miserable, DON'T EAT THE PEPPERS!\n\nEggplant\nDan Dan Noodles \nRed Oil Wontons\nand for the non-spicy lovers - Mongolian Beef\n\nComplaints would be that the service can be a little rude, wish they had more drink\/food  choices for kids & at times I have felt like the floor was dirty\/grimey...\n\nBut, kind of like the soup nazi, I'll come back for more food regardless of the rudeness!\n\nIt's that good.","339":"Why is there a laminated new lunch menu but a whole section of it is not available? I went in for lunch today and was pleased to see the reasonably priced lunch specials. I don't eat beef so I  looked at the chicken options and chose one. The waitress then told me as I ordered that \"we don't have the American ones\" referring to all the chicken dishes save one. Because communication wasn't easy, I don't know if they never serve the Americanized dishes or just not today. I'm guessing they don't serve them at all as it was a whole section of the lunch menu. Why are they on the menu to begin with??\n\nI ended up with shredded beef with bamboo shoots. The bamboo shoots were a little different than other places and only so-so. I could tell everything was fresh and prepared well, but I was still annoyed that they bait and switched me with their menu. \n\nThe restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly, but there is most definitely a language barrier. Lunchtime parking is really a challenge. I'll maybe be back, but I hope next time they are serving their whole menu. \n\n5% discount for cash.","340":"My favorite chinese restaurant in Chinatown and actually in Houston. Water boiled fish is amazing!!! Service can be slow sometimes but this isn't a place for a quick lunch. Food is spicy but delicious!","341":"It's pretty good Chinese flavor in US. I especially like the fish. Recommend.","342":"I tried this place for lunch last week for the first time.  It was great!!! Went with a couple of friends from work that eat there on a regular basis.  They ordered for me and every single dish was great.  My favorites were the boiled fish and the bamboo roots.  Textures and flavors that I've never had before.  Will definitely visit again soon!","343":"Eaten here 3 times and food is great! I mean spicy, flavor..\nService is standard, portions are decent...\nReally no complaints, this place won't disappoint.  Kung Pao chicken, cold cucumber is awesome","344":"My friend brought me here for some authentic Sichuan food. I'm always wary of getting Chinese food because my parents make some of the best Chinese food around (I know they're my parents and that sounds biased but I swear wait til you have my parent's Chinese BBQ and you will experience heaven in this lifetime) - but the food here was actually quite good and different from what my parents usually make. Thanks for breaking me out of my Chinese food mind block Mala Sichuan :-)","345":"I came to try this restaurant out when visiting Houston, so I'm speaking from first impression. I ordered the dan dan noodles, saut\u00e9ed green beans, and crispy chicken. All three dishes were made well and were for the most part, sizable. Although I cannot speak for consistency, I was pleased to taste that the saut\u00e9ed green beans were young and fresh, something I can't always say about this dish. The dan dan noodles offered a good amount for the price of $5.95. The crispy chicken was really enjoyable because of the unique basil flavor, however the dish was smaller than I thought it would be. \n\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and plan to come back!\n\nPS-There is a 5% discount when paying with cash.","346":"Hands down one of our favorite restaurants in Houston.  We order here at least once a month.  We've tried a lot on the menu and our favorites are:\n\nSpicy crispy chicken\nWater boiled fish\nDan Dan noodles\nMapo tofu\nWater spinach with garlic\n\nAll the food is delicious and flavorful without being too spicy.","347":"Another authentic Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. If you like spicy, this is the place to go. They have some great spicy dishes that are full of flavor and complex undertone tastes. They also have some non spicy dishes for those of you who can't handle the spicy.\n\nWe got a fish dish, a dandan noodle dish, and a satay potato dish. The fish and noodles were pretty spicy, but the fish dish was pretty oily which I didn't like as much, but the fish was cooked to perfection. The noodles were very standard and great tasting. My favorite was the satay potatoes because they were crunchy and I loved the hints of vinegar flavor in it. It also helped that it wasn't spicy and put the fire in my mouth out. \n\nThis place is definitely the place to be for lunch because it got packed when it hit lunchtime. We were lucky to get there a little early and didn't have to wait for a table, but there was a line about 10 minutes later around noon. The place was pretty small so there wasn't much room to sit, but I appreciate the fact that they don't place you at a table with random people when the lunch crowd comes in. \n\nThe price was very reasonable and we got a lot of food for the price. Between 2 people and 3 dishes, the bill came out to be around $23. The service was also quick and respectful. Overall, a great place to try, especially if you enjoy spicy foods.","348":"This place serves the spicy greasy Chinese food and let me tell you, they know how to cook here. My husband and I don't shy away from greasy food and this place is worth breaking your diet. The cold bacon garlic roll is so tasty, I wanted to order extra to go. I had the pork with bamboo shoots, yummy and my husband got the water boiled beef. The menu shows which dish is spicy or not. Great selection of veggies, cooked to perfection. I did not like their duck but everything else, I enjoyed. One star off for the very limited seating. Lines and wait can be so long.","349":"I love Mala! This is the place that I would take my parents first if they came down to Houston and wanted to explore Chinatown. It's very clean and nice on the inside, and the service is generally quick. All the dishes are about $7-11, and though all the portions are basically for a single person, it's a great place to do family-style, as you'll definitely want to try more than one thing. \n\nThings I've tried (I don't know the names of all of them so I'll just name what I know):\n\n-Mapo tofu - the classic and it is SO GOOD. The spiciness level is very bearable. Super savory and full-flavored.\n\n-Mala beef tofu - comparable to mapo tofu, but the tofu is softer and there's meat. This is my favorite dish, actually. \n\n-Ants on a tree - not a spicy dish, so if you want something to cool your tongue, I would go for this.\n\n-Red oil wontons\/dumplings - these taste pretty similar to me, to be honest. A little too saucy, but good.\n\n-Crispy chicken - I would skip this one. It's basically really tiny, really salty bits of fried chicken. The peppers in this are pretty hot.\n\nFinal note, Mala gets pretty crowded on the weekends. If you want to eat with a big party, I recommend getting there before 6.","350":"This place has the greatest chow mein noodles. The house special spicy noodles were amazing! The noodles were a little to spicy for my tolerance, but the flavor was great. Now, the dan dan noodles weren't that good to me. They made my tongue tingle; they lacked flavor. The red oil dumplings were a little salty but other than that they were delicious.","351":"so apparently you can't waive your eight amendment rights! I was supposed to get the Electric Bear last night, but my lawyer hooked me up and today I'm a free citizen of the USA. Praise the Lord for my freedom! He wanted me to leave jail despite the terrible things i have done and the pain and suffering i have caused. But.... i will makeup for it! I will eat at Mala every week until I die! It is only fair. I have brought suffering into the world, so now Mala will bring me joy to cancel it out...just like in the bible... Luke 4:21......\n\nthis restaurant is tha bomb- and not like the one i made in my step mom's garage apartment- lol! the only fire here is the one in your mouth, and it won't leave five people burned like my failed insurance scam! I'm so happy that i \"got out of jail free\" and can once again eat at Mala- my favorite chinese restaurant! Get crispy spicy chicken and water boiled fish.... they are perfect- like freedom!","352":"Came out to China town for the first time with frens \nDidn't know most of the menu but my friends \nOrdered a lot of different dishes \nEvery item was great but garlic bacon appetizers rolled with cucumber in red oil is the most have \nThats one of the best appetizers i have had \nAll items were so fulfilling and the food was perfect spicy \nWill def be back \nThe food is great","353":"We ordered spicy fried chicken- it is good, a little too salty; big meat balls, we ordered it before, it's very good, this time we tasted odd favor, may have been in flour. Salty pork was tasty!","354":"The food served here was decent for a Sichuan restaurant. Most dishes have a set level of spiciness. Some of the waiters have difficulty speaking English so you have to be patient with them. When busy, the wait could be very long. Luckily i went on a Saturday evening and was seated within 15 minutes. Overall is go to this location again.","355":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in China town. Their food is literally addictive.","356":"Absolutely my go to place now in Bellaire. Never fails to give out delicious food. I always get Spicy Crispy Chicken and the House Chow Mein with pork. Such classics there and are so tasteful everytime I go. Great service also. It can get pretty busy in there but if you have no problems with meeting new people, you can get seated with another party and make new friends that way also.","357":"I came back to try the dishes that I didn't get to try the first time. \nCame around 1:30pm on a weekday and the restaurant was about half full.\nWe ordered the cucumber sticks, water boiled fish, spicy and crispy chicken, and dan dan noodles. \n\nCucumber sticks- I didn't know it was gonna be pickled, but I'm glad it is! Thought it was gonna be literally fresh cucumbers lol. It's pretty much like kimchi, but without the spice and it was a little too salty. Still good though!\n\nWater boiled fish- This came out super fast and I was super hungry. Maybe its a sichuan thing, but a lot of the dishes tend to have a lot of that red oil in it. I think there was too much red oil in this dish and I wasn't too fond of that. Other than that, the flavor was right on and the fish was good. Just didn't like having to wipe my mouth after each bite cause of the oil. \n\nSpicy & crispy chicken- When a fellow yelper said it was like the chicken bites at tapioca places, I was sold and had to get this. I was not disappointed at all with this dish. There was a bunch of peppers and I felt cheated a little cause half the plate was dried peppers and I had to dig through to some chicken. Other than that, it's a favorite!\n\nDan dan noodles- I expected a lot from this dish since it was a favorite among so many people. Maybe because the chicken and fish came out first and I started to get full, but the dan dan noodles didn't make me go \"wowww amazing\". It was good, but it wasn't something that was out of this world. It tasted almost like regular stir fry to me with lots and lots of oil. And peppers of course. \n\nOverall, I really liked this time better than last. I'm definitely going to come back and try these along with other dishes. But one thing I gotta say is that everything was a bit too salty for me. Had to take a sip of water after each bite lol.","358":"Overall a good experience. Waiters were very attentive to us, food came out quick and hot. The food was great for people who love spice. A lot of flavors and the crispy chicken was to die for. Will visit again","359":"Good thing this place is 40 mins from my house because I would eat here all the time and go broke. The service is good, the food is amazing! My favorites are: spicy crispy chicken, water boiled fish, crispy mala beef, chillen cucumber sticks, and hot and soup. \n\nI actually don't like Chinese food much in general because it tends to be bland for my taste (love Vietnamese and Korean food..) but I guess I love sichuan food. Definitely worth eating here.","360":"Came here from Austin for a weekend Houston trip. A friend recommended Mala for dinner. It was so good and for a great price. I was really impressed. I hadn't enjoyed Chinese food like this in a while. \n\nThere was a wait but it wasn't so bad. This was basically the only restaurant that had a wait in its location.","361":"When it comes to Sichuan food, I admit I'm really picky. If a place advertises \"authentic Sichuan cuisine!!!\" then it needs to be superior in spiciness, numbness, and legitimate Sichuan dishes (so no orange-teriyaki-chicken-eggroll nonsense).\n\nMala gets a star for spelling \"Sichuan.\"\n\nFood is good. I think every dish is toned down for the masses. The spiciness isn't that spicy, and the numbing isn't that numbing. For the name MaLa (numb and spicy), it's a little lacking in those sensations. Don't be intimidated by the scary red oil-seasoned food topped with red pepper flakes.\n\nOverall, it's a good meal. Service is great! Yes, more water to my non-spicy eating friends! Yay, refill my rice! Also, paying with cash = you get a discount. So bring your fam, bring your friends. Noisy, crowded, and good food.\n\nGet the wontons, spicy fish... Just spicy all the things. If you're okay with inner organ dishes, try the large intestines with basil.","362":"Oh my gosh I LOVE this place! I had their cold spicy beef salad and also dan dan noodle. My boyfriend ordered their tilapia and cabbage dish and it was not only tasty but also a HUGE portion (we brought home leftover of it enough to feed three people!) Will definitely come back again soon!!!","363":"The quality of the food has gone down a little, but I still like the place\n\nMy favorite dishes:\nhong you chao shou (red oil wontons)\nsuan ni bai rou (garlic bacon) \nqingjiao tudou si (sauteed potato)\nmala pan roasted tilapia or the boiled fish","364":"I dream about this place. Something so different, something so fun and weird to eat (in a good way). If you have never had Sichuan, they use Sichuan peppers. It has a numbing effect when you eat their food. \nI frequent this place at least once every two weeks. Everything I have had here is good. Whenever I have friends or cust that come into town, this is the place I take them to and, they too, enjoy it.","365":"Very authentic and delicious. Good service as well! Strongly recommended.\n\nThe spicy chicken and fish are so good","366":"There is no doubt this place take its cooking and service to the utmost level with all the competition around Chinatown in Houston. The spicy dishes are just right where you would crave more of its beauty. I can go on for this place but it's better I let you be the judge.","367":"We've been here four times so far, and every time we have selected dishes that were tasty and excellent (4 star). However, the last time was on a Saturday night (the first time we went there while it was full) and our dishes were disappointing (3 star), and the staff was a little patronizing (2 star).  I'm not sure we'll go back here, with so many other great Chinatown options.\n\nThe Funky Stick Chicken:  This one we made the mistake of not realizing it was in the \"cold dish\" section. The sauce is flavorful, but the combination with the cold chicken the texture was a little slimy.\n\nTwice Cooked Pork. Flavorful - basically a lot of bacon, but a little greasy so best in moderation.\n\nBaby Pepper Black Bean Beef. This was the breaking point. The menu description is \"... shredded beef and onions, cilantro, Serrano peppers with in black bean sauce.\"  What we got was \" ....shredded beef and onions, cilantro, Serrano peppers, and little chopped up bits of black bean in a red oil sauce.\" The sauce was similar to the red oil sauce they use with the wontons or dumplings appetizer, and the dish tasted very oily. When we complained to the staff that the sauce wasn't what we were expecting, we were assured that it was a black bean sauce (they pointed to the few chopped up black pieces) and stated \"It's authentic, not like what you're used used to with Panda Express or other Westernized dishes.\"  \n\nI've had black bean sauce in plenty of sichuan restaurants (maybe not authentic ones). I've never had it at Panda Express, or any fast food Chinese restaurant. It's always been a brown sauce with actual black beans in it, and it tastes like black beans.  You can Google \"beef in black bean sauce\" and look at the images and pretty much everything looks the same.  This was not that.  It's entirely possible that my expectation was incorrect, and in some cuisines, black bean sauce can be more of a red oil with tiny bits of chopped black bean that doesn't really taste like black bean, but to assume that I my expectations were based on presumptions learned from eating at Panda Express is insulting.\n\nThe hints of attitude and prejudice displayed here is a real deterrent, with respect to it's \"authentic\" label. They even go so far as to have about 12 dishes on their Chicken menu and cross out 8 of them. If you ask why they are crossed out, it's because \"we don't serve westernized dishes here.\"  Yes, I get that you don't want to serve popular westernized Chinese dishes like \"Sweet & Sour Chicken\" - so don't put it on your menu then cross it out to make a point, and don't ASSUME that your customers knowledge of sichuan cooking is limited to Panda Express.\n\nPS: Truth is, there are still plenty of good dishes. On previous visits we've had dishes including the Red Oil Wontons (better than the Red Oil Dumplings), Crispy Mala Beef, House Special Chow Mein, and they were all quite flavorful good.","368":"Doesn't live up to the hype I've seen lately.  The food wasn't anything special  and our table of 4 ordered 6 different dishes, all were OK to bland.\nMight have been an off night but we've had much better Chinese food at several different resturants.","369":"This is probably one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the entirety of Houston, which is saying a lot for me. I'm not really a picky eater, but having lived for 8 years in East Asia, I have some pretty strong preferences when it comes to Asian cuisine. Furthermore, I'm not usually a fan of spicy food, so the fact that I like Mala Sichuan Bistro is a pretty big deal. \n\nMala Sichuan Bistro provides authentic Sichuan cuisine and it does so at a reasonable price point. The spicy crispy chicken was spot on in terms of texture and flavor, and I was stuffing my face (at the expense of my low spiciness tolerance). The eggplant is a good break from the feeling of face burning, and the chilled cucumbers balance out a spicy meal. While other reviewers seem to take issue with the amount of oil present, I think this is generally par for the course in Sichuan cuisine. If you want a salad, you are in the wrong place.","370":"Went in for a supper and it was really busy but one of the perks of eating alone on business was there was no wait time.\n\nI chose the wontons, Dan Dan noodles and the smoked duck cooked in chillis.  All three dishes were great with my favourite being the noodles.\n\nThe duck had a great flavour to it and was a big portion, the free white rice was overkill but a nice touch.","371":"Food: 4\/5 \nService: 2\/5\n\n     We came in with six people on a Sunday around 3:00 hoping to try something new. We were immediately acknowledged and sat down. As soon as we sat down we waited for menus, no one came around. I don't expect much from bellaire really, I know some places have terrible service but I don't think I've ever been sat down without a menu or a drink order for that long. \n     Took about ten minutes for us to finally flag someone down, and then the waitress only gave our group two menus? Uhhhh... Okay? We had to get up and get our own. Then once we were ready to order, had to flag down another person.    \n     Once we ordered the food, the wait for it wasn't long, came out pretty quickly. \n     Food was really good. Break it down:\n\nGarlic bacon: Very delicious and quite different! I really enjoyed the freshness from the cucumbers and liked the garlicky sauce paired with it! \n\nDan Dan noodles: not my favorite thing in the world, barely touched them! There was just so much peanut\/sesame??? I couldn't handle it.\n\nSaut\u00e9ed pork bacon and veggies: very tasty! Not too spicy and had tons of leeks I believe and onion! \n\nMapo tofu: This was alright. Had a nice flavor to it but just wished it was a little spicier and more meatier! \n\nRed oil wontons: one of my favs! Much spicier than I previously thought it was going to be, but I was not complaining about that!\n\nSpicy and crispy chicken: you need this! Even if you don't think you need to order it, you do. Seems like a staple that people get here and I enjoyed it! Like the name says its crispy tiny pieces of chicken that have what I would describe as maybe a dry seasoning? Very good! Only thing I would say is I wish the chicken chunks were larger :(","372":"Co-worker 1: What's Sichuan food?\nCo-worker 2: No idea. Ask Patrick; he's Asian.\nMe: Really, guys? I'm not some sort of Oriental encyclopedia.\nCo-workers: ...\nMe: OK, fine! It's basically spicy Chinese food.\n\nAlmost every time I'm here, I find myself ordering the smokey Cumin Beef and the Water Boiled Fish Filet (swimming in a red-orange pool of chili oil, of course). What baffles me is how spicy the House Special Cold Noodles are. It's cold, and then hot, and then cold, and then hot as if you're eating habanero ice cream or something. Also, this is the only place I would ever order bacon that isn't fried to a crisp.\n\nMy co-workers and I probably have very different ideas of what spicy means. While they cringe at the thought of Tabasco, I know the pain of wading in a puddle of your own sweat by the end of a meal. Fortunately for me, pain is pleasure.","373":"I like this restaurant. I always to come there, sometimes I do it alone and sometimes with my friends. There is always fresh food and it is very tasty. The service is not bad but it is not on the highest level.\nIt takes time to wait for the order. The workers are friendly, kind but they are not fast.  This place is clean and the interior is nice.\nAnd the prices are not cheap, but I like tasty food so I can pay much money for that, but not every one can.","374":"Try This:\nwater boiled fish ( love me, love you crazy )\n\nlion's head ( tell me if you with it )\n\nkungpao chicken ( baby come and get it )\n\ncummin lamb - not listed on the menu ( maybe try a new thing )\n\ngolden hook wintermelon ( and let's spark a new flame )\n\nyup, mala is my new flame on bellaire.\nstop looking for love in the club and try it.","375":"I'm not sure I'll ever stop thinking of this meal.\n\nAt the advice of some all-things-Asian aficionados, we sat down to bowls of dan dan noodles, and WOW. The consistency was perfectly chewy without being gummy, the crumbled meat added great texture and flavor, and mixing it with the mellow chili oil all equaled out to a dish I want to have again, then again. \n\nThe red oil dumplings were simple and yummy, although I prefer a more delicate wrapper. The bacon and leeks dish was nice, with salty\/chewy pork, fresh crisp veg and another mellow oil-based sauce that is nothing like what I imagined when it was described as \"sweet flour.\" That's a good thing. \n\nThe spicy crispy chicken is as everyone says--small pieces of crack. To expand on that, they're super juicy (re: dark meat) with mouth-watering seasoning. I could snack on these for life. The Mala pot-roasted tilapia is also a killer, with juicy, flaky meat swimming in a satisfyingly spicy sauce. Get it just to watch all your dinner friends' eyes light up.\n\nService is quick, professional and attentive. Beer is cold and washes all that spicy down well. The only way this place could be better is if I was eating it all in my jammies with a healthy helping of Netflix.","376":"The dan dan noodles has got to be one of my favorite dishes of all times. It's a chili oil with ground pork over hand made noodles. It was delicious and not too spicy.\n\nthis was the other appetizer was dumplings in chili oil. Pretty self-explanatory. The dumplings were boiled. I wish there was more flavor to the chili oil.\n\nMala pot roasted live tilapia. The fish was very fresh and spicy! Joe loves to order live fish from any Chinese restaurant we go to.\n\nThe tea smoked duck had lots of layers of flavor but the duck was a little too game-y for me.\n\nPieces of dark chicken fried with dry hot chili peppers. This is by far my favorite dish of all time. And this restaurant was no exception. This dish was delicious!!","377":"The food not bad in town. But the service very bad they added 16%tips on the bill.We want to pay more but we stop it. That's the bad rules on the service business. Not recommend this place.we never go back.","378":"Upon walking in, the restaurant had a very authentic Chinese atmosphere. The aroma of the restaurant was inviting and I could not wait to sit down and start eating. The food was nothing short of amazing. We ate family style so I was able to experience a wide array of delicious, flavorful dishes. Some of my favorites were the Yang Zhou Fried Rice, the Mabo Tofu, the Pork and Bamboo Shoots, the Kung Pao Chicken, the Crispy Beef and Celery, and the Chow Mein. You cannot go wrong with any of these. The restaurant truly lives up to its name and you can rest assured that your experience will be full of authenticity, immense flavor, and sensational spices.","379":"Really disappointed. Had red chili dumplings and green peppercorn beef.  Dumplings were ok. Peppercorn beef was inedible. Beef was tough and not very tasty just spicy.","380":"I'm so excited I gave Mala another try because it is ridiculously delicious!! Our party of 9 was seated in the private room where a minimum charge of $150 is required. Service is typical of a Chinatown restaurant, but they speak English here, it's pretty clean, and they accept credit cards (albeit maximum 2 per table).\n\nMy favorites were the Dan Dan noodles! Absolutely addicting. The noodles were perfectly al dente and tasty, sauce was salty and not too spicy, and ground meat was flavorful. I was too stuffed to get a second bowl but I'm seriously salivating just typing all this out!!\n\nHouse special noodles were like a lo mein but so tasty!! Everything was really greasy, but that didn't deter me from eating!! Sooo good!\n\nEggplant dish was another greasy favorite. Yum yum! I need to know how to make their sauce! \n\nI am a major wuss when it comes to spicy food so I can't really critique the rest of dinner because it was too too TOO spicy for me to handle. Even the above dishes were so spicy I had to drink three refills of my iced tea. Mala is a nice unique addition to the mostly Cantonese and Vietnamese offerings on Bellaire Boulevard.","381":"I can't say that this restaurant is better than others serving the same cuisine.  I can say that it's not worth the long wait. The food is a little bit too salty.  Service is fair and the food comes out quickly.  Overall, it's a restaurant you can try once or twice but not a place I would go to regularly.","382":"Wow, I am blown away with the water boiled fish dish. I used to live in China, never got into Chinese food but this restaurant has changed my mind.","383":"I ate here twice within three days.\n\nMy friends ate there three times within five days.\n\nThis place is a definite win and quite possibly my favorite restaurant in Houston. Spicy lovers, rejoice.\n\n1) Beef Tendon, Beef Tendon, Beef Tendon. delicious.\n2) Twice Cooked Pork. Humongous portions. Delicious.\n3) Dan Dan mien: Simple, yet tasty.\n\nThe other dishes i tried were still tasty, still good, but not must-haves:\ncumin beef, fried intestines, mala fish (this one had too many bones, not enough meat, and not really worth the price)\n\nThe service is quick and attentive. Come hungry!","384":"Love, love, love Mala's... Lip numbing spicy. Get the Spicy Crispy Chicken, Mala tendon, and Crispy Mala Beef.","385":"Lotus tofu is not tofu. It's more like a dumpling. Has no tofu chew or taste to it. It tastes more like flour-made dumplings.  And, this particular \"tofu\" had a slightly \"off\" taste. Maybe it was starting to go bad.  I might have liked the dish a little more if the Spam was replaced with lean pork slices.  Spam has a way of making every dish seem \"cheap\".\n\nThe Dan Dan noodles has a serious spicy kick. The flavor was only ok.  The lamb with vegetables dish was ok, also.\n\nThe presentation of food on the plates was nicely done.  The dining room decor was clean, bright and fun.  I especially like the colorful dishes that decorate the wall.\n\nService was very good. The wait staff is very polite and attentive.\n\nI personally would not come back again as the food was not what I was looking for.\n\nBut, I think it's definitely a fun and good place for those who crave Sichuan food...just don't go specifically for the Lotus tofu...unless lotus tofu is supposed to taste like flour-dumplings, I don't know.","386":"Heard of this place from friends. It's a bit pricey compared to the Sichuan food in LA. But the food is good. The bean noodle (liang fen) and the garlic bacon is good. Especially the garlic bacon, they made it into a roll with veggie inside, pretty good.\nThe potato shreds were ok and not really have the correct taste... and the spicy beef, hmm... pretty standard.","387":"Always a favorite spot to take care of my Chinese food craving....\n\nLove their quick service, clean dining area and awesome food.","388":"Wow! I absolutely loved all three dishes I tried at Mala. I got the red oil wantons, the veggie chow mein and tasted my dining companion's spicy cold noodles and all were amazing. I also got a mini bowl of complimentary rice. Keep in mind though, I was starving when I got to this place because I hadn't eaten anything for 7 hours, so I may have enjoyed the food more than I would under normal circumstances. Still, every bite was worth it, especially because the portions were pretty big for such reasonable prices. \n\nThe service was great-- our waiter was friendly and we got out food very quickly. \n\nThe ambience was so-so. The interior design was very simple and practical and the room was packed with people, but given the high food quality, this wasn't a big deal for me. My friend said the bathroom smelled really bad, so all you I-can't-pee-unless-it's-clean-and-smells-like-my-grandmother's-rose-soap people (like me!), keep that in mind. \n\nSorry for the lack of photos! I was so hungry, I wiped my plate clean before I could take a presentable photo.","389":"Sichuan food is one of my favorite cuisines so I'm always up for trying new sichuan restaurants.  This is by far the best sichuan restaurant I have come across in Houston.  I have tried around 4 sichuan restaurants and this is the best.  The inside is clean and the service is great unless it's real busy hours, you might have to wait for 30 minutes as the seating is very limited.  Nevertheless, the waitresses are really helpful and good\n\nThe food is awesome.  Had theses dishes here before: mapo tofu, spicy crispy chicken, cold dish shredded chicken, dan dan noodles, westlake beef soup, boiling fish fillet with cabbage\/tofu.  Had no complains about any of the dishes.  Also, they use the steel chopsticks which i think is a necessity for eating sichuan dishes (not those crappy disposable chopsticks).  Also they don't bitch or whine when you ask to split the bill unlike some places in chinatown.\n\nIf you want to try Sichuan food and it's your first time, highly recommend you to come to this place!","390":"Do I know anything about Szechuan style cuisine, Nope! Do I know what incredible food tastes like, YES! Sparing the background on Szechuan cuisine, I can tell you that this type of food is very unique and very different from other Chinese places I have eaten.  I will assume it is authentic but if it is not, who cares?  It is delicious.  We started off ordering bamboo with chili.  I was so amazed by the flavor.  It was very tasty and if this appetizer was larger, it would have been my main course served over rice.  Eating bamboo for me was a first!  To complete the meal, we ordered garlic spinach and the fried chili chicken served over a bed of rice.  One word, DELICIOUS! Im not really into cooked spinach but they managed to really make it tasty.  The fried chicken had a salty\/sweet taste with spiciness.  It was just the perfect combination. This place is definitely cleaner, friendlier and tastier than other places in this area!  You will not be disappointed if you choose to dine here!","391":"Consistently good food and big portions. All dishes are full of flavor and spice. My favorite dish is the spicy garlic eggplant, the sauce that it comes with is so good, I can eat it with rice all day. \n\nI've tried the red oil dumpings which also had great flavor as well as the spicy crispy chicken that was a party in my mouth. Not too fried and delicious. My friend and I must have overloaded our pallets because after eating the dumplings and the spicy crispy chicken, I couldn't taste the wonderful garlic sauce of the eggplant. So I got it to-go and had it for lunch and it was just as good as I remembered.\n\nNext time I come here, I'll try to divvy up the dishes to something that can balance and not out-flavor each other. The seasoning is so rich you should order a vegetable dish to be able to taste everything and cleanse your pallet.","392":"My first experience with Sichuan food! This place was quite busy but we eventually got seated after about 30mins of waiting. Took some yelpers advice, ordered the spicy crispy chicken, dan dan noodles, pepper duck, and red oil dumplings. I really wanted the water spinach as well but they didn't have it that day. (I've been trying to get water spinach at other places as well for a while now but nobody seems to have it... is there a shortage or something?? :() They gave us a generous bowl of rice to share between our table and gladly refilled it when we ran out. The spicy crispy chicken was SOO GOOD! I would go back for this alone. It was crispy, flavorful and it was a simple dish but we all enjoyed it very much. Went great with rice. Dan dan noodles was a first for me, after thoroughly mixing it, I can't explain the flavor but it was a really interesting combination that grew on me. The more I ate it, the more I enjoyed it. The pepper duck was okay... I definitely prefer peking duck over this. It was extremely smoky and just had some strange taste I'm not too crazy about. The red oil dumplings were yummy! The dumpling itself was a bit chewy, had an okay amount of meat but the red oil all over it made it taste oh so good. \n\nI was also quite surprised at how good the service here was! The servers constantly refilled our drinks and checked on us to see if we were doing okay (that's so surprising for an Asian restaurant). Overall, we had a wonderful experience and I would definitely come back to get my spicy crispy chicken and to try some other dishes as well!","393":"It's sad to admit but I really was not aware that there was different variations of Chinese Cuisine.  I have been exposed to Sichuan style food and now I actually know the difference.  Their entrees are very surrounded by the pepper! But their food is not overly spicy, it's very flavorful, a little bit oily.\n\nMy friends and I ordered a variety of dishes.  This place is very popular so if you come during dinner time expect to wait.\n\nWe got the mala tilapia, it was good, but really not worth the 16 bucks, for a small whole fish.  The cumin beef was similar to the flavor palette of an indian dish, if indian food included beef.  This one had very few peppers and a big portion of meat, the sichuan bamboo shoots is a cheap side dish, but a good add on to a bunch of meat dishes, but what really stood out was their spicy and crunchy chicken dish!\n\nThis was the best out of all of the entrees and a MUST order.  The pieces of chicken are chopped up small and deep fried and covered in spices.  By the end of the dish I was digging for more pieces of meat like searching for gold.  So addicting!","394":"Let me guess, you probably have not heard of this place if it weren't for Yelp or you have one nice Asian friend.\n\nSuper flavorful dishes. Friendly and attentive staff. Nice ambiance and superb experience overall.\n\nYou need to get two things here:\n1. Garlic Bacon. It's pork belly\/bacon rolled with cucumber sitting in a garlic sauce. It's like THEY KNOW this will clog your arteries but wrapping it in cucumber might make it less lethal.These little packages of porky goodness taste so light. It's not what you would expect with a normal bacon. This is best eaten room temp or even chilled. Amazing appetizer.\n\n2. Spicy Crunchy Fried Chicken. It's little pieces of chicken (boneless), fried until crispy. Mixed with Fried garlic pieces and a cornucopia of fried chili peppers. DAYYUM. It's like popcorn chicken gone wild. It also has sichuan peppers which will numb your mouth, literally. It's so goooooooood.\n\nFINAL TIP: I personally think that this is one of those places that you HAVE to bring friends or family with you. The dishes here are amazing and they're definitely something you can talk about.","395":"Took my family here in June and it was probably the best Sichuan food we've ever had.","396":"Mala-tongue still tingly. Okay, I tried. Unlike my attempts at puns, the food here is good. \n\n4\/5 Food. I had their dumplings, lo mein, fried rice, chilled intestine noodle soup?, and their crispy chicken. I love intestines but that particular soup was way too sour and there was literally 3 small pieces of intestines in the entire dish. The chilis in the chicken dish did their job and made my tongue all numb and tingly. It was a sort of s&m food experience; there was pain but just the right amount to have me coming back for more. Wait what?\n\n3\/5 service. I had mixed feelings (still talking about the restaurant). Host was attentive and polite. The server was on a mission to get our orders so that he could tend to other guests, which is a smart and efficient tactic for him, I must admit. But it left me feeling ignored and pushed away. He was so cold. Lucky for him the food was hot enough to warm my spirits. \n\nAt this point, my review surely holds no merit but if it somehow does, this place serves great Mala cuisine and I recommend it.","397":"The restaurant had a good variety of Chinese cuisine, and I really enjoyed the cumin beef! The different dishes are on the spicy side in flavoring, which I loved:) We went for dinner on a Friday evening, so the wait time was about 25 minutes to seat four people. Pretty popular restaurant, and I can see why!","398":"I'm Chinese and this is my go-to Chinese restaurant. Nuff said.\n\nSalt & Pepper Jumbo Prawns\nSpicy Water Boiled Fish\nBeef spicy tendons\nSpicy Crispy Chicken\nHouse Spicy noodles\n\nThank me later.","399":"I had higher hopes for this place with all the hype and wanted to try the original restaurant before their new location opens in Montrose.  Over all the food was tasty, but I have had much better food at better prices in Chinatown...I am glad I tried it, but I will stick to other places like FuFu and East Wall when out in Chinatown...I look forward to trying their Montrose concept to compare the two.","400":"I though the food here was pretty meh. I tried the dumplings, beef bowl, and tea-roasted duck: they were good but nothing special. And though I know that oils are very typical of Sichuan food, many of the dishes I've had here were overly greasy. Service and ambiance are nice, though. Probably won't be returning any time soon.","401":"We were all hungry and looking forward to stuffing our faces...only to breathe in the stench of literally doodoo as we were approaching the restaurant. Seriously, it smelled like ass. There's a sewer in the front of the restaurant and when the wind blows in your face, it carries that horrible smell. Anyway, I came here with a party of 3 on a Saturday night around 7:30 PM. There was a wait since its prime dinner time. We waited about 10-15 mins for a table. While waiting, I couldn't help but notice how diverse their customers were (there were lots of white ppl and even some\nmiddle eastern). This is strange for Chinatown. And no, the nonasians did not have an Asian person in their group. \n\nIt was my first time so of course I went to Yelp to look for the tasty dishes to try. We ordered mopu tofu, black pepper beef, spicy crispy chicken, and water boiled fish. Everything was tasty and very flavorful. The dishes aren't too spicy, but I could see there were lots of spices and seasoning and my stomach definitely felt it afterwards. My stomach tends to act up when I eat foods with lots of spices even though I might not think it was spicy while eating it. The beef was tender and not spicy at all for those non spicy eaters. The water boiled fish has cabbage in it as well and is kind of soupy or drenchy in their sauce. They aren't stingy with their fish so it's definitely shareable for a party of 4 or 5 easily. My favorite would be the spicy crispy chicken. It's like little chicken nuggets that are super crispy....not really spicy. I didn't think any of their dishes were really spicy. \n\nEveryone in my group enjoyed the meal and would most likely come back again to try out some other items. I highly recommend the spicy crispy chicken! Minus 1 star for the terrible smell in the front of the restaurant, and also their food seemed very oily so I'm sure health wise, my arteries are probably getting clogged.","402":"Loved the food.  The Yangzhou rice was delish.  Also tried the crispy chicken and kung pao...awesome!!!  They didn't have the spicy garlic chicken for whatever reason but everything else was great.  Try the hot\/sour soup it's good.","403":"The Dan Dan noodles are awesome here.  Not too spicy but enough heat to give you that nice numbing effect. Definitely gonna come back for other items like the tea smoked duck.","404":"This is my first Yelp post, but I had to review this place because of how amazing it was!! \n\nService = A+ (our server was sweet, and when I dropped my chopsticks she was right there with a new pair for me before I even picked them up!) \n\nFood = A \nThe food comes in family sized portions for the most part! Come here for with your spouse or best friend and share some really good food! Me and my boyfriend got the sweet and sour soup (there was so much left over we took enough back for probably two days), the Kung Pao chicken (it was okay, the chicken was really good, but there were some kind of capers on the chicken that left my mouth tingling as if I had licked hand sanitizer but overall it was really good), the chow mein (was probably my favorite! The noodles were amazing, the flavor was fantastic, and I couldn't stop eating it), and the red oil dumplings (oh my god, they were really good! Came with 8 and only got through about half of them because of so much food). There's a complimentary big bowl of white rice that comes and the food is just so good and super affordable. You'll leave full, happy, and with leftovers to start it all over again! Highly recommend and will definitely be back!","405":"This place is really clean...\n\nAnyway, Mala is delicious, and the food came out quickly. Like many others, I ordered the dan dan noodles, and they were fantastic - not too oily, good amount of spice (though I would've preferred more), nice sized portion. Makes a great meal for cheap. My friend ordered their cold noodles, and we were given a whole pot of rice for free! Didn't even touch it because the noodles were more than enough.\n\nWill return! Look forward to other dishes.","406":"Very good. We had the spicy crispy chicken....omg amazing. the garlic bok choy and dan dan noodles were also delicious. The only thing I didn't like was the dumplings.","407":"I'm not sure if the peppercorn they use just tastes salty or that they immerse their food with salt. My fiance is Vietnamese and he said the food was too salty by Vietnamese standards (since apparently they love their sodium). I had to take 2 bites of rice per bite of food. I can honestly say I will never go back. It is too salty tasting and greasy for us. His mom couldn't even eat it and she loves salty food. \n\nWhat I ordered: \n\nSpicy Crunch Chicken --super salt bomb\n\nRed Oil Dumplings --too oily and salty\n\nDan Dan Noodles --least salty and most decent dish\n\nMa Po Tofu --too salty but somewhat edible","408":"Absolutely delicious place that a good friend recommended to me! I love being able to find hidden gems like this. I had the spicy fried pork intestines and holy moly that was delicious! You got a lot of food for the price you paid which was awesome. I can't wait to go back and try more things on the menu!","409":"Yummy yummy yummy.  Very spicy.  Will be back many more times with this guy.   It was good and crowded.   Need a bigger place.","410":"There's a reason why this place is often mentioned as the \"go to place\" by local chef's. One word: Delicious! The salt and pepper prawns and boiled fish are mind blowing. Service is great and super fast. Beer and wine selection is surprising!\n\nGo. Eat. Enjoy. Repeat.","411":"Very good service, 2 seconds after we told them what we wanted to order the food was at our table and warm to!","412":"If I could give Mala more stars, I would.  Our meal here was absolutely amazing and I am already making plans to go back whenever I return to Houston!\n\nWe came on a busy night but did not have to wait too long to grab a table (with a lazy susan no less!!).  We ordered the red oil dumplings, the red oil rabbit, the dan dan noodles, the mapo tofu, the three pepper beaten duck, the chengdu style pot roasted prawns, and the mala crispy beef.  Oh. My. Goodness.  Everything was amazing!! The dan dan noodles were nice and chewy and full of spicy flavor.  The wrapping on the dumplings were chewy and had such a great mouth feel.  The mapo tofu sauce was thick and spicy and went perfectly with our steaming hot rice.  The duck was tender and crispy and moist.  The prawns were juicy and absorbed all that rich flavor - not to mention they were a good size! The mala crispy beef was a show stopper - thinly sliced spicy crispy morsels... delicious!  I didn't enjoy the rabbit as much as I thought I would because there were so many bones amongst the meat, but the meat tasted great. \n\nThe service there was great - our waiter was very nice and made sure we had everything we needed.  Overall, it was a very enjoyable feeling and we devoured almost every last bite!  I recommend this place with very high regard - I cannot wait to come back!","413":"Update with more dishes:\n\nI love the Mala beef tofu, really good sauce.\n\nThe hot and crispy chicken was good, I thought it was too salty but my husband loved it!\n\nWe also tried one of the house specials of intestines and congealed blood and that's was way too adventurous for me.","414":"I'm officially addicted to the burn of Sichuan spices. Thanks, Mala. Thanks.\n\nMy brother and I decided to come here on a whim one day, and came back three times in the next two weeks because we craved the burn, simple as that. It was December when we first came, so it was winter. However, the inside of the restaurant was just as cold if not colder than it was outside! They were blasting the AC! At first, I was a little annoyed, but after my meal, sitting there wiping away my own sweat, I understood the necessity. Not only was the food super spicy, it was also super good! Here's what we ordered:\n\nGarlic Bacon: An appetizer that is bacon wrapped in cucumber, drenched in a tasty mild sauce that goes great with anything. I would recommend having this dish on the table if you're going to go for the spicier dishes, as it acts as a good palette cleanser\/cooler between spicy bites. Also, dip the rest of your dishes in this sauce and they'll always come out tasting yummy.\n\nFour Joy Lion Head: Four meatballs in sauce with vegetables. These are the most tender, juicy, and flavorful, fall-apart meatballs you will ever have, I promise you. My brother is something of an amateur cook, and he was boggled at how they got the meatballs so freaking tender. This dish is a MUST. Especially if you have someone at your table who can't take the heat, this is perfect. Get them this. They'll shut up.\n\nWater boiled fish fillet: This one takes the HEAT to the next level!! The fish fillet is so flaky and tender, but dang the sichuan peppercorns they sprinkle throughout the oil is SO DARN SPICY. This dish has me in tears every time and I'm crying to the heavens for the burn on my tongue to lighten up, but I keep going back for more. And when I go home afterward, all I can think about is when I can go back here and go through it again! \n\nRed Oil Dumplings: Pretty good, not bad. Not sure if I would order this again. Good if you like dumplings. I guess I was never much of a dumpling girl. \n\nEggplant in Garlic Sauce: This dish was just okay. The sauce was a little too sweet for my taste. \n\nHINT: If you're the kind of person who drains their water when eating spicy food, sit somewhere you can see your waiter and he\/she can see you. You'll be flagging them down for water refills every five minutes.\n\nANOTHER HINT: If you pay in cash, you get an automatic 5% off your bill. \n\nEnjoy the burn!","415":"This place is always packed - a good sign. We just went this afternoon at 2pm and had to wait about 20 minutes for a table, but then it got less busy. \n\nMy wife and I loved Sichuan food when we went to China a few years ago. This is place is authentic, but not as tasty as what we had in China. Food was very oily. The dishes were swimming in oil. Not enough Sichuan pepper in some of the dishes. And spice level is low, even on the dishes marked as very spicy. Meat (we tried beef and chicken dishes) was not great. The tofu was good. \n\nService is friendly, but rushed. There are a lot of tables in this small restaurant. \n\nBring cash - as they give 5% discount for cash payment. \n\nThe parking lot for the mall where the restaurant is very congested, and it's hard to find parking.","416":"After months of sitting on my must try restaurant list, I was thrilled by the opportunity to finally give Mala Sichuan a try over Saturday dinner while catching up with some friends.  As expected, there was a wait, and they only seat complete parties.  So our party of 6 had a short wait (15-20 minutes) before we were seated.\n\nWe ordered an assortment of entrees as this was everyone's first time, and we wanted to get the full experience.  The Dan Dan Noodles were my favorite - but nothing extraordinary and easily replicated at other Chinatown noodle houses.  We also ordered the Crispy Mala Beef, Salt and Pepper Prawns, Crispy Chicken, Ma Po Tofu, and Cumin Beef per suggestions of Yelp and other friends who had been to Mala Sichuan before.  While all dishes had decent flavor, what I didn't care for was the fact that the Crispy Chicken and Crispy Mala Beef dishes were essentially red pepper dishes with a hint of the respective protein.  \n\nThe flavor of the food itself would have kept Mala Sichuan at a 3-star rating, but two hairs found in our food knocked this review down to two stars (one in the Dan Dan Noodles, one in the steamed white rice).  Yes - I know it's Chinatown and cleanliness\/hygiene are not the reasons you dine there, but once you see something like that in your food (twice!), it's difficult to maintain your appetite...","417":"Damn, this was the first Sichuan food I ever had...tasted a new world...It can depend on your preferences but damn it so good....","418":"Had a great time at this unique joint. It's only for those who enjoy spicy. Please order the wontons in red oil, the dan dan noodles, and the spicy crispy chicken. All awesome!  Protip: pay with cash and get a 5% discount.","419":"In the late 1990s and early 2000s, ten or twelve of us would have a monthly \"Chinese dinner\" in Bellaire. There were a few restaurants we really enjoyed and somehow we would get out of there for about $12 including tip, and this included beers for some of us. A few weeks ago, ten of us chose Mala Sichuan Bistro to have our \"Chinese dinner reunion\" and we were not disappointed. They gave us the party room and told us that we didn't even have to have the minimum of $150. The food was delicious and dishes like cumin beef were amazing. I had never tasted cumin in such a way before. The smoked tea duck and crispy chicken were all delicious. We ate EVERYTHING on our plates! \n\nThe service was friendly and we had a great time. The total came to $14 per person including tip, which is not a huge leap from what we were used to paying long ago. Everyone was extremely happy with this meal and I'm sure some of us will go back before the next \"Chinese dinner\" happens.","420":"We have been to Mala a few times.   Although I would appreciate the food being a little less spicy, it is delicious.   My favorites are the chicken and eggplant.    Went for a banquet also and there was nothing I didn't like.","421":"I don't think I could ever get tired of this place! My husband and I love spicy food and every time we come here, our spicy craving is definitely satiated! \n\nFirst things first, the restaurant is located in a very difficult area of Bellaire where the traffic is always busy and parking can be limited.  I'm used to Chinatown's traffic so it doesn't bother me as much as some others.  \n\nThe restaurant does get quite busy and majority of the tables are for parties of 4 or more.  I've never tried to make a reservation here (some reviewers here have said they do take reservations, while others say they don't).  From my experience, I've never had to wait over 10-15 minutes for a table.  \n\nNow on to the best part...the food!  We've tried quite a few dishes here but here are our main favorites:\n\n1.  Dan Dan Noodles:  My absolute favorite!  I usually order it even hotter than the standard recipe calls for. \n\n2.  Black Pepper Beef w\/ Serrano Peppers:  One of our favorites! We order this every time we go there and just love it!  My husband and I are real spicy food aficionados, so we even eat the serrano peppers!\n\n3.  Cabbage with dry red chili:  The cabbage is extremely fresh and very refreshing with all of the spicy food. \n\nI wasn't a big fan of the Red Oil Wontons and Red Oil Dumplings, unfortunately.  In my opinion, the spicy soy paste was too salty and there was very little meat inside the wontons and dumplilngs. \n\nAll in all, this place is amazing!  The wait staff here is nice but sometimes, due to the dining room being so busy, you may have to remind them of things that you previously asked for (i.e., refills on water, etc.).","422":"The food is delicious. I recommend getting the spicy crispy chicken dish, eggplant dish, water boiled fish, and crispy Mala beef. I think out of the 10 times I've been there I've gotten this exact set of dishes for 9 of them. Service is super fast too! It usually takes ~10 minutes for the food to come out. Great place to eat authentic Sichuanese food. The food has that characteristic anesthetic spiciness - the opposite of pain one normally feels when eating most other spicy foods. I dare you to eat a Sichuan peppercorn, it'll make your mouth go numb!","423":"We were here for a light dinner. We ordered a few appetizer and snacks. Great portion for us. My favorite was the spicy noodle.","424":"We went to the location that's not in China town. We came from out of state, but I should had known better. I didn't know they have 2 locations. So this review is for the other location. The food presentation was good. The temperature was not. Some stuff aren't hot enough and definitely didn't seem like fresh made. Also, their fish (\u8c46\u74e3\u9b5a\uff09definitely was not good. It was very blend and no taste to it. We will not return even if we were in the area in the future.","425":"I'm a fan. The food is authentic, non-americanized sichuan cuisine. The peppers are the highlight of the restaurant and plenty of their best dishes contain plenty of sichuan peppers. These lovely vegetables leave a tangy-zippy-hot zen on your palate that will confuse those that are tasting it for the first time and lure those that have tried it before to return. \n\nThe fresh pot roasted tilapias are brilliant so long as you don't mind a whole fish on your plate and some tactical spoon work to get the fish off its bone. The foods here are very oily so don't go expecting a healthy meal. The pot roasted tilapia probably scoops up a full cup of oil. Thankfully, you don't actually eat all the oil in a sitting but unthankfully, you do get your fair share. \n\nService isn't grand but I don't know many restaurants on Bellaire Blvd that have \"service\" in their customer value propositions. Go to Mala Sichuan if you want to try authentic Sichuan cooking.","426":"Seating arrangements were something I didn't appreciate. Food, oh my goodness was superb! Friendly staff. Definitely worth another visit.","427":"Yum really authentic Szechuan food. I didn't love the rabbit cold dish because there were a lot of bones but my tofu fish soup was great and the morning glory was tender and perfect.","428":"Summary: fair price, great food, friendly staff, great service\n\nIt was the New Year's Eve when we got here. It's great to have a warm place like this when it's cold out. When I said 'warm', it isn't just the temperature, but also their staff. We were ushered by smiles. Even the waiting list was long, we were seated maybe 20 minutes after we got here. The food is great, authentic to me. Not that spicy as we thought. We asked for some small amount of rice but they were generous and gave us a whole refill. The waitress we had was very friendly. At the end, we asked her about recommendation to a bubble tea place and she gave a very satisfying suggestion!","429":"I'm usually not the biggest fan of spicy food, but this place is definitely the exception. I literally can't get enough of the food. Usually when I come with friends, we'll get the mapo tofu, crispy chicken, and a spinach dish. However, I'm positive there are plenty of other good dishes that I haven't tried yet. The food has just the right amount of spicy and is just overall delicious in general. It can get very busy for dinner, so if you really want to avoid crowds, go during off-hours.","430":"Tried this place out for the first time with friends and I find this restaurant OKAY. Perhaps I am more comfortable with HK and Taiwanese food and not so much on Sichuan. \n\nWhen we first arrived, they wouldn't seat us until all of our party has arrived. \n\nThen as first time comers, we wanted some time to review the menu but we were approached 5 times all within 5 minutes. If they were that anxious on getting our orders then they should have gave us the menu to look over until our party arrived. \n\nWe decided to have the Crispy and Spicy Chicken, Water Boiled Fish Filet, Saut\u00e9ed Water Spinach and House Special Friend Rice. \n\nRanking from spiciest to least would be: House Special Fried Ride, Water boiled fish filet, Crispy and spicy chicken, and Saut\u00e9ed water spinach. \n\nOther Yelpers were not joking in the overwhelming peppercorns for the Crispy and spicy chicken. The food was decent but not the best I have had. I enjoyed most was the Saut\u00e9ed water spinach out of all the dishes. \n\nIf you want to burn a hole in your stomach with red chili oil, peppers, and peppercorns then this is the restaurant for you.","431":"It's time to update this review...I clearly can't stay away from here, so this joint is worthy of five stars. Probably more, for their service and consistency.\n\nThe Dan Dan noodles are nothing short of amazing. The noodles have that amazing fresh-pulled texture, I could probably eat them without any sauce. Best noodles anywhere, with just the right amount of heat...do not miss this. They were out of this one night when I came, and I almost cried. Everything here is good, so it's hard to narrow it down, but if I had to choose...my other favorites are the funky stick chicken, red oil wontons, and the lion's head meatballs.\n\nWe've gotten to know the staff pretty well too...very friendly folk. They always bag up our leftovers when we're finished with our meal.","432":"With all of the hype I'd heard about Mala Sichuan, I thought it was good but not out-of-this-world.  All of our dishes were good, but the stand-out was the dan dan noodles.  Most of the dishes are fairly spicy, and the service was great.","433":"Really great food. Came here after a friend suggested it a 2 months ago and I've been going regularly ever since. The food is reasonably priced and is absolutely delicious. The service is also pretty good and the waiters were very attentive. There is a slight issue with language. Most of the wait staff speaks Mandarin but they can have trouble understanding English. For example a friend of mine asked a waiter what he liked on the menu and had to repeat the question several times before waiter understood with hand gestures and simplifying the question. That aside, the wait staff has no question understanding your order and are incredibly friendly. Definitely coming again.","434":"Very yummy.  As a loyal Chinese food fan, I have to say this did not disappoint.  Even if you are not a spicy food fan there is something for everyone.\n\nSweet wine fish filet - (4.5\/5) - I love this dish.  Incredibly yummy with a great balance of acidity and sauce.  The fish is not overcooked and every time I try this the quality is consistent.  Do try!\n\nSauteed potatoes with white wine (5\/5) - I LOVE THIS.  It's shredded potatoes stir fry in wine.  It is a very uncommon dish outside of Chinese food, but trust me it's really delicious.  The potatoes are shredded into thin slices and stir fry with some green onions to give it perfect texture and flavor.  So delicious.\n\nSpicy beef filet - (4\/5) - Also good but on the more spicy side that lingers.  It's not very tender but does have a lot of flavor.\n\nStir fry lotus root with chili (4.5\/5) - Not many know about this veggie.  But this is a crisp veggie with ton of flavor and stir fry in chili pepper is for sure one of my favorites.  If you are feeling adventurers, definitely try!\n\nIn general, lots of good food options.  I would say the beef tendons are a little bit subpar and would not recommend.  Do try it though!!","435":"Literally the best place I have ever been to for Chinese cuisine ! There fish are fresh and delicious !!","436":"What the freak happened here? Usually fellow yelpers are on point but I highly disagree in this case. Most 1 star reviews talk about the service and but I'm about the food and that's what my review is based on. Btw service was just fine, no complaints.\n\nThe best thing we had were the red oil dumplings, my only gripe is that they were too small. I had the Crispy and Spicy Chicken and my friend had the Tea Smoked Duck. \n\nWHY IN GREAT ZEUS'S NAME would you add so many Sichuan peppercorns to a dish? Chef fail 101! Don't get me wrong it wasn't terribly spicy but overloading the dish with the peppers gave it a very unappealing bitter taste that was made worse by the numb nut in the back who was in charge of salting the dish. Bitter and crazy salty = Unedible.\n\nAs for the duck, I simply found the taste repulsive. Its not kind of duck I've come to expect in Asian cuisine. \n\nIt could have been what we ordered but I found the food terribly inedible to the point I'll never give this place a chance again.","437":"By far my favorite Chinese place in Houston. The staff is always friendly, the food is on point, and I love the spinning tables for big groups.\n\nLuckily, when I say I'm making a trip to Chinatown, I end up rounding up a big crew of Rice students and we're able to get a private room. It feels so personal. And since we're such a big group, we order a ton of dishes and split them. Having ordered 15 dishes, I was rarely disappointed.\n\nThe red oil wontons and dumplings are to die for. The best I've had in Houston. The wrapping is fresh and the sauce on the dumplings is the perfect amount of spice. Plus, you get unlimited rice so dump all the extra sauce on rice and enjoy. \n\nThe rest of the food is also fantastic, and a little spicy. The kung pao chicken was a crowd favorite. The tea-smoked duck is excellent, as the duck is nice and tender, and the smoked flavor really comes out. I'm usually not a fan of Chinese fried rice but the yangzhou fried rice was flavorful, as I especially loved the ham. I also usually dislike tofu but the mapo tofu was amazing. The tofu was soft and melted in my mouth. The only dish we didn't really like was the red oil rabbit as the rabbit was really salty and the dish had more bones than meat. Still, this place is fantastic. I highly recommend getting a big group together and getting the private room to feast in.","438":"One of the better and cleaner restaurants in Chinatown. The service is also above average.\n\nFood is really, really good. Some of the cold dishes can be a little on the salty side but that's what rice is for, right? Others might be too spicy, so pay attention to the number of peppers next to each menu item. Overall, the flavors are strong and can get pretty spicy since it is a \"Sichuan Bistro\". Stay away if you like light and healthy.\n\nI would definitely recommend trying their tilapia. Super tender and flavorful, regardless of which one you order (they literally have a section on the menu just for tilapia). But WARNING to all those who don't eat meat with bones, this is a whole fish NOT A FISH FILLET!! Also try the cold noodles (there are two different ones)...so yum!\n\nDon't forget to bring cash because you'll get a 5% discount!","439":"There are a few dishes here that are worth getting in combination such as the garlic cucumbers with dan dan noodles. And the crispy chicken is good if you can find it in the sea of red peppers...but outside of that, the food is usually sitting on beds of oil and salted as if they were preserving it for the winter. I've come here 4-5 times, each time b\/c somebody else in my party wanted to come here, and I've tried a variety of their dishes, but disappointed each time. There's usually a wait, the service is okay, not great, and the food is inconsistent, oily, and oversalted. So no reason for me to come back.","440":"My go to place when I want Chinese food that's not Americanized. Expect to wait if you go here after 6pm on weekends. I try to go here at random times like 3pm. \n\nHere are things that I've tried as far as I can remember. \n\nSpicy crispy chicken: 4\/5\nDan Dan noodle: 4\/5\nBacon wrapped in cucumber: 4\/5\nWonton in red oil: 3\/5\nSoup with crab and asparagus: 3.5\/5 \nBok choy: 4\/5","441":"A University of Texas MBA grad started up Mala Sichuan, and he knows what he is doing in all aspects: not simply defaulting to BYOB as most Asian eateries do; doing his homework in regards to authentic Sichuan flavors; and maintaining the no-frills vibe of the smattering of restaurants in Chinatown.\n\nWhat makes one choose one specific joint over another? Not much, aside from the fact of loyalty, the nuances of the cuisine, and the occasional difference in dish preparation. Here, the Sichuan style lends itself to spicy, numbing flavors, coupled with a touch of cleanliness not common to Chinese restaurants.\n\nSpecifically, the noodles are a must. The dan-dan and cold are both easy on the stomach and tasty on the palate, though the spice might do a number on your mouth. From the sprinkling of green onions to the porky nuances, their noodles appeal to all aspects of the diner's culinary desire.\n\n\"Crispy and Spicy\" Chicken needs not further explanation. This Sichuan staple satisfies the fried needs of your meal and fulfills the protein quota--remember: Chinese people don't center the meals around meat...\n\nMSB has my support as one of the top culinary experiences in Houston.","442":"We were seated for about 10 minutes with no attention brought to us. We had to ask to be given menus and waited another 15 minutes before they took our food\/drink order. The place died down and the service was still lacking. At the end of the meal we paid our tabs and the waiter proceeded to ask \"you aren't going to leave a tip?\" The food was outstanding but the service just wasn't there","443":"My first visit to Houston and hoping to find good Chinese food (since I haven't found any in Texas since I moved here 10 years ago from Miami). The food at Mala was DELICIOUS! We had the Black Pepper Beef and Spicy Crispy Chicken. Service was great. I think I'll move here...","444":"Oftentimes, eating Sichuan food will reaffirm your place in this universe by making you fully cognizant of just how much happiness can be derived from food. \n\nI've tried a number of places specializing in Sichuan food both in and out of Houston and return here consistently. I've been here 10+ times, including a number of trips within just days of each other, and I have yet to tire of this place. \n\nFood: \n\nGo family style if at all possible to take in as much of the extensive menu as you can. When I go with only one other person, we order two dishes and an appetizer and are usually beyond full. \n\nQuick rundown of my most commonly ordered dishes. \n\nWater Boiled Fish : \nThis is my go-to order here. Whether you've never had Sichuan food or wake up every morning from wonderful dreams of Sichuan peppercorns, you owe it to yourself to try this dish. The fish is extremely tender and flavorful, and the spices all complement each other nicely without one being overpowering. Fairly spicy but nowhere near as scary as the three chili pepper sign would indicate. Mala's fish-to-vegetable ratio is among the best I've had. The beef version of this dish is also spectacularly well done.\n\nBasil Intestines:\nGreat complement to the spicier dishes. The intestines are cooked (not deep-fried) with basil, onions, and a sauce that's just the right amount of salty. I'm not sure if I've ever seen anyone else order this, but it's probably my most commonly ordered dish that isn't water boiled fish. \n\nMapo Tofu: \nClassic Sichuan staple that can be ordered without meat here. A crowd pleaser for sure. Mala's version has the distinctive Sichuan numbing spiciness but is not actually very spicy at all. The tofu is always fairly well cooked, but the dish as a whole is generally not as soft and mushy as other versions that I've had. \n\nDan Dan Noodles:\nMala's interpretation of this dish doesn't have a very peanut-y flavor, which I won't make a value judgement on. There's a decent amount of minced pork in here, and they do a good job keeping it not too salty while still being flavorful. Very mild in terms of spiciness.\n\nHighly recommended dishes:\n-Eggplant in Spicy Garlic Sauce\n-Stir Fried Pork Kidneys\n\nRecommended:\n-Shredded Pork with Bamboo Shoots (a great non-spicy option)\n-Crab Meat and Asparagus Soup (another good non-spicy option)\n-Crispy chicken\n-Garlic Bacon appetizer\n-Cucumber Sticks\n-Kung Pao chicken\n\nNot recommended:\n-Cumin Beef (too salty for my tastes)\n\nService:\n\nThis place gets crowded on weekends with a good mix of both Asian and non-Asian families. Consequently, service during rush hour can be a little slow, but they make up for it by being ridiculously fast otherwise. The English descriptions on the menu are extremely detailed by Chinatown standards. Service is very attentive and the waiters usually have very good English. I usually don't care about or even notice service in Chinatown, but Mala's is consistently good.  \n\nIf you go with a small group of people during a crowded time and are willing to share a large table with another small group, you'll be seated much more quickly.\n\nPros: The food makes you feel alive in the best possible way, service\nCons: Food can occasionally be a little salty, can get crowded on weekends\n\nDishes to try: Water Boiled Fish, Basil Intestines","445":"Went to MALA twice and the food was just amazing both the time. Their complimentary rice is perfectly cooked. We ordered the chicken entrees and they are spicy hot and flavorful. \n\nWill visit again.","446":"Food was yummy. Spicy and filling. Fish is obviously fresh because they have fish tanks filled with tilapia. Service could have been a lot better but there were only 2 waitresses for the entire floor so water was never refilled. However, the waitress's recommendation of the roast pot mala tilapia was on point. With a side of garlic bok choy, it was a perfect meal without the usual heaviness we have come to expect after chinese food. This is not your average american chinese food. They have authentic dishes and are super tasty so forgo the regular fried rice and order roast pot tilapias and cumin beef and other sichuan dishes.","447":"OMG! This little hidden gem is amazing. Never have I ever liked any Szechuan restaurant in my whole existence!!! Thanks to a very good friend, I now have one :)","448":"Dan Dan noodles- they're alright. It lacked flavoring. Tip is to mix all the oil that's sitting at the bottom and bring it up to the noodles. That's probably what we didn't do . \n\nRed oil dumplings - YUM! These weren't spicy at all and we ended up ordering a second round. \n\nEggplant in garlic - was served super hot at first so beware! But it was good, very greasy though. I wouldn't say it's the best eggplant I've had since there are better. \n\nBaby bok Choy with garlic - very crisp and light.  It tasted different from other Boy Choy dishes I've had, I can't quite put a finger on it to describe. This was probably the healthiest\/least greasy meal of all our dishes.\n\nWater boiled fish fillet - in a very greasy oily pot! It's reviewed highly in many yelpers posts but I didn't find it quite spectacular. It's so heavy and drenched in oil that I couldn't eat too much of it. \n\nOverall the servers were attentive and my experience with the food was ok. I wouldn't pick this place as a must try\/go to restaurant amongst other Asian restaurants though. It is pretty cheap, I give it that!","449":"Great food, very good service. Top notch place!\n\nWater boiled fish is the star! Super tender. \nMa pao tofu was good.\nNapa cabbage was really good. They cut these well and the flavor was borderline perfect. \nCrispy chicken came with tons of peppers.  Flavor was good, but id prefer bigger and better quality chicken. The chicken pieces were small and hard.\nDan Dan noodles were mediocre. Not salted enough and dry. Might be a fluke considering how many ppl love it here. \n\nAtmosphere was casual and the place looks pretty clean. 5% discount with cash. I'm def coming back and trying more dishes.  Mm hmm.","450":"I came here based on good yelp review. But my experience was rather not good. I ordered hot&sour soup, red oil dumpling, chicken fried rice, and mapo tofu. Hot&sour soup was bland and dumpling was good but way too salty. Fried rice was so so. I've had better. Food overall didn't meet my expectations.","451":"Dinner at Mala sichuan -- Overall, not bad!\n\n+ clean restaurant, how rare :)\n+ excellent water service, comes in handy when you eat the spicy plates\n+ 5% off if you pay by cash\n\n\nOrdered:\nKung pao chicken - good dark meat entree with the peppers\n\nMala beef - pretty good but they cut the beef into thin  pieces so after 5 min the beef got dry and it felt like I was eating beef jerky\n\nMala Tilapia - steamed fish, very fresh -- worth getting","452":"This is the most authentic Sichuan restaurant in Houston so I highly recommend it for people to drive a few extra miles to try it out. \n\nOne thing that I think is useful to know is that \"Mala\" is two adjectives in Chinese, numbing and spicy. It is more about numbing than burning your mouth the way Jalape\u00f1o pepper does. This is why this pepper corn is so highly prized because of its rich flavors and because it does not burn you. Don't let the red color in the sauces scare you. It will only numb you and won't go over the top.","453":"Hot diggity! I don't normally like spicy foods but I couldn't pass up the raving reviews about this place. Thank goodness they had varying degrees of spice intensity! Probably not the healthiest for you since most dishes come with the spicyu \n\nWent for lunch with some co-workers and split some of the dishes. Based off of others' reviews:\n- Dan Dan Noodles (Omg...it's so delicious I wish I would've just gotten this for myself as a meal! These noodles tasted fresh - texture and taste were amazing!) \n- Red Oil Dumplings (I asked for the red oil on the side and add on the red oil so I could figure out how spicy I could really handle. Again, the dumpling casing was delicate and so fresh tasting)\n\nWe split the Cumin Beef (very flavorful) and one of the Prawn dishes. Again, can't complain about anything we had. It was all so good.\n\nGood service; clean restaurant. Thank goodness they filled up our water glasses regularly with all the spicy dishes we had! FYI, 5% off bill if paying in cash.","454":"I have been here over a dozen times now. I can't help but order the same thing - Szechwan chili chicken and cumin lamb. One of these days my cravings for these two would be satiated to a point so that I could move on to the rest of the menu. \n\nThe dishes are pretty authentic. I've tried the same in a couple of places in Beijing. This place holds up well. Don't complain about the amount of chili and peppercorns. That's how it's made and need to be experienced the same way!!\n\nThe location of the restaurant is not great. The strip mall is a bit on the dirty side. The owners would do well to move this to a nicer location. \n\nThe fish tank is a bit nasty too. Once I witnessed fresh stock being bright in through the front door. That was a bit gross. \n\nTaking away one star for ambiance.","455":"Great good food indeed, this is the location to go. DO NOT GO TO LOCATION IN MONTROSE, unless you are voluntarily looking to be ripped off in prices, service and quality. \nThis location in 9348 Bellaire Blvd, since surrounded by probably many other great Asian restaurants keeps them in check in about their food service, quality and prices. Aside from the obvious sad fact that if they could openly ripp you off, they would. There is no denial that this location has awesome food though.","456":"I was so excited that I finally got to try this place. The restaurant looks clean and simple and the service was friendly and quick.\n\nThe spicy and crispy chicken lived up to all the hype but I found the boiling water tilapia to be a little bland. The cabbage and sprouts were flavorful from the broth and the fish was fresh but the fish needed some more time to simmer in the broth to get some flavor. I would definitely return though to explore more of the menu.","457":"if you're worried about the spice, don't. We got a few dishes that were the highest level (3 chilis) and it was spicy but not overpowering. Looks scarier than it is because the chili oil is bright red. \n\nGot the water boiled fish like pretty much everyone on yelp recommended (thank you for that), dan dan noodles without the pork, and hot and sour soup. Total was about $21 and we took a bunch of it home because the portions were so large. \n\nBeen to a lot of chinatown places and I'd highly recommend checking this one out.","458":"I order the Cumin Beef was good, flavors were spot on good combination, and the service is very nice. Good environment, quaint and relaxing, the oriental music is a nice touch.","459":"Great first time experience at Mala Sichuan!\n\nWent on Friday night with some friends and was pleasantly surprised by a wait of only about 15 minutes even though it was packed. \n\nWe had a lot of fun ordering because at first they gave us someone who didn't speak English so we were going around in circles trying to ask questions. \n\nEnded up going with some Yelp recommendations as well as looking at things that looked good on other tables. \n\nThe spicy crunchy chicken was tremendous. Small bits of chicken that were juicy and cooked perfectly with incredible flavor. And none of the disgusting fatty pieces you are afraid of. I will definitely get that again next time. \n\nOther highlights were the chow mein combo. Great flavor and meat was nice that was included. \n\nWe also tried water boiled fish which was a grouper. This was a really interesting dish that was spicy and really flavorful. \n\n\n\nOverall great experience. I can't wait to go back and try new things on the menu.","460":"Dined at Mala Sichuan on a Sunday. It was kind of crowded for dinner. They let you book a private dining room and require a minimum order of $150. There were a bunch of us so we ended up getting the private room. \n\nWe ordered family style so got to try lots of different items on the menu. I would recommend their hot & sour soup and crispy beef. The Dan Dan noodles were good too. We tried their crispy chicken and lamb but the crispy beef was hands down the best one! The Kung pao chicken was my second favorite. Definitely worth a visit!","461":"Ugh, now why did I do that? I stuffed myself silly... again! Maybe because the food was so good?!\n\nCame in a group of 4 and I think we went a little overboard with our order: dan dan noodle, pig's blood and intestine hot pot, Mala roasted tilapia, eggplant, and green beans. Everything was delicious except for the pork hot pot. It was very oily, rather bland and the intestine mushy from being overcooked. I wouldn't order it again. \n\nThis place got the thumbs up for the toughest food critic in the family, my mother!","462":"We tried quite a few dishes here and had a lot of leftover to take home. The cucumber bacon was wonderful and the crispy chicken was great as well. I was not as impressed with the Dan Dan noodles, but that is probably because I do not like noodles much in the first place.","463":"We wanted to try something new and were curious what Mala Sichuan Bistro had to offer.  The reviews on Yelp were very high so decided to give it a try.  Arrived around 6:30 pm on a Saturday and we were the second person on the wait list.  The wait wasn't long so it was good.\n\nWe ordered a two main entrees and three appetizer dishes.  The appetizers were Garlic Bacon, Mala Beef Tendon and Yanghou Fried Rice.  The Garlic Bacon is not your typical bacon. It's the 3-layer boiled pork that's wrapped around cucumber and topped with Mala sause and garnished with scallions.  It's different, not your typical appetizer dish. It's worth trying at least once to see if you like. The Mala Beef Tendon would be better with beer. I'm Vietnamese, so I think it's more of a dish to eat while you're drinking beer, but it goes well with food too. Nothing fulfilling but it's more for the texture I suppose.  The fried rice was good. The description said it has ham, but i think it's more like spam. I like spam so didn't mind it, but I can see it being misleading if someone was trying to avoid processed meat to find spam in their fried rice. The main courses were the Spicy Fried Chicken and Tea Smoked Duck.  The spicy fried chicken was flavorful. It's lightly battered, fried and mixed with a bunch of dry red peppers. It was good but towards the end, I had enough of the greasy taste.  The dish that i was most impressed was the Tea Smoked Duck. This was the first duck ever  at an Asian restaurant that was actually moist, tender and flavorful. Typically ducks at asian restaurants are dry and more bones than meat, but this duck was the type that you would find at nicer high end restaurants. You can actually taste and smell the smoke in the duck as well.  \n\nWhen we left the restaurant, I was so amazed at the long wait in front of the parking lot. There were at least 30 people outside waiting in line. Some were drinking beer while waiting.","464":"Located in the heart of Chinatown on Bellaire this little gem totally stole my heart with it's spicy content. I love a place where I am not so overwhelmed with the lack of knowledge about a particular culture\/cuisine that I don't know what to order or worse order something gross. \n\nMala has yummy food and even tastier traditional wines and beers.I ate so much here that It's hard to recall the entire experience because I was HIGH on food! The servers were great and the Owner\/Chef who hosted us was super sweet! I hope to return.\n\nTHE FOOD \n\nMala Bamboo Shoots (Slender bamboo shoot tips tossed red chili oil and sichuan peppercorn oil) - SPICY but great \n\nThe Chillin' Cucumber Sticks (Baby cucumber sticks tossed with cilantro in sesame oil, sichuan peppercorn oil, and grinded garlic) were quite refreshing after the spicier dishes. I literally could have eaten a plate of these! \n\nThe Peppercorn Arctic Surf Clams (Arctic surf clams tossed with green onion oil and sichuan peppercorn, very unique flavor) were by far the most interesting thing I tasted. They have smooth texture and a \"chew\" to them. But they were good..in an interesting way..take a walk on the wild side! \n\nThe Garlic Bacon (Chilled bacon and cucumber rolls slathered with a tasty sweet and spicy garlic sauce, garnished with green onions) gets ALL MY STARS. My table mates had to hide them from me or I would have devoured them all..in a heartbeat. The sad part is I surely have cucumbers and bacon at home..why can't I make things that taste good? \n\nThe Fish Fillet and Sauerkraut Soup (Light sour soup with flounder fish fillets, spinach, sweet potato, vermicelli, and sauerkraut) was ok. I didn't get much but the broth was delectable. \n\nSpicy and Crispy Chicken (Crispy dark meat chicken saut\u00e9ed with hot red chilies, whole sichuan peppercorns, and sichuan bean curd sauce) AMAZEBALLS. \n\nI suggest that simply order this. You won't regret it.","465":"food is not so good, service is slow, \nonly spicy, nothing taste","466":"Very good and very spicy! They do have a minimum order of $150 to reserve a private room, but I was glad we did (party of 12), because the line for this place is always out the door. I'd recommend the MaPo tofu, the fish dishes, and fried rice for kids as it was not crazy spicy.","467":"The spicy chicken is a MUST!  we also ordered the wontons in red-chili oil.  These were pretty yummy.  I love homemade wontons and you can definitely tell these were just that!\n\nOur party also ordered the cold Dan Dan noodles; they were not particularly exciting to me but everyone else seemed to enjoy them.  The other dish we had was the water-boiled beef with sauteed leeks and napa.  The \"water-boiled\" part, I wasn't too keen on . . . just a peculiar description.  But it was very good, seasoned just right, spices were nice and the beef was just soooo tender!  yeah, hate it when that happens, huh?  :P\n\nGotta be wary sometimes!\n\nThis was not my first visit to Mala.  We really like it.  It is always way too busy in there.  But it really is worth the wait!","468":"I love this place! After hearing hype about the red chili oil dumplings, my family and I decided to check it out, and we were not disappointed. Our favorite dishes we had were the dumplings, the Dan Dan noodles, and the water boiled fish. Everything was so flavorful but not too overwhelmingly spicy (just a tongue tingling amount), so this would be a great place for any taste. The only dishes I wouldn't recommend are the spicy crispy chicken (since there were more peppers than chicken) and the special fried rice (which I didn't think was anything special).","469":"We used to like this place, but the recent visit made sure we won't go back.\n\nIt took them more than 20 mins to bring our food out after we order, however, as soon as I put down my chopsticks and was about to take a 5 mins break before I can go on eating, there came the check! The server goes \"There are lots of people waiting, so if you don't mind, I can get your food to go for you.\" What?! I came here to dine-in, not to go! At the same time, my husband was still having food in his mouth!\n\nI was very surprised by this because they used not to be like this. Some friends of mine also mentioned that they were treated like this - go for a dine in, but almost got \"kicked out\" of this place before they finished their meal.\n\nOverall, I think this place is overrated too much recently. It got too popular and the customers coming exceeded the capacity of the place can hold, and the owner only wants to get more and more business and neglects \"the money already in the pocket\" - people who already ordered and received their food are going to pay anyways so don't have to accommodate them too much.","470":"Excellent Sichuan cuisine! I love the Dan Dan noodles and the eggplant. The spices are like no other, a must try for sure!","471":"This has quickly become my favorite Chinese restaurant in the States. Hands down the most authentic Sichuan cuisine I've tasted outside of China. The flavor is spot on and really has a nice kick. When you order meat, that's what you get, not a bunch of vegetables like you sometimes see elsewhere to save money. The waiters are very friendly and prompt. The dishes are served family-style on a round-table. It is a pretty crowded space so try to come on a weekday if you want to avoid a loud environment. I don't live in Houston but this place has become a must-visit every time I'm in town.\n\nTry the Cumin Beef, it's the most flavorful dish I've had in a long time. \n\nAlso do NOT come here if you dislike spicy food. I recommended a friend here who said he thought it was just average because he doesn't like spicy food so he ordered some non-spicy dishes. Well, that's not Sichuan cuisine so of course it will be average at a Sichuan restaurant...that's just common sense.","472":"This lunch was our first visit.  Everything on the menu is well marked showing how hot with pepper each item is.  My partner and I each ordered a  one pepper entree, the black peppered beef and the crispy chicken.  We also ordered a veggie rice dish and  a bowl of hot and sour soup. Little did we know that we would get a huge bowl with about a quart of soup.  We  shared and everything was excellent.  Service was excellent.  I am still eating hot and sour soup at home, 30 hours later.","473":"Top Notch Pot of the Outlaws is the best-named dish in Houston.  Unfortunately, I didn't get to try it... my dining companion thought it overkill.  Probably too much for two people.  But maybe just overkill in general.  After all, we aren't outlaws.\n\nThough it was just the two of us, we managed to put away a variety of delicious Sichuan fare.  We tried a new menu item, frog; perfect flavors, not too spicy, lots of little bones to eat around. Cucumbers in oil were tasty.  And the country-style blood curd dish: delish!  I'm not going to pretend I loved the intestines (maybe they're better fried?) but the broth, blood curd and tripe were rich and yummy.  Gringa that I am, though, my favorites were the chewy, spicy dan dan noodles and  tea smoked duck: tender, neither oily nor dry (duck can be tricky like that), subtle flavor.","474":"Normally I'm a huge proponent of grading a restaurant based on food, rather than ambiance \/ service.  Mala's food is very good.  However, they are egregious on how they treats customers.\n\nIn the 1500s, Martin Luther posted his '95 Theses' to the church doors.  Today, I will post my '3 Theses' on Yelp (based on numerous visits to Mala):\n\n#1:  We called to see if they take reservations, they do not.  We show up and are seated at a table and get our water\/drinks.  Mala told us to get back up because the table is already reserved.  I thought they didn't take reservations?  Call me old fashion, but I think it's a bit rude to ask customers to get back up after seating them.\n\nWe wait for another 20 minutes and left.\n\n#2:  Ordered two Dan Dan Noodles.  Other tables got their Dan Dan noodles before we do (they ordered after us).  Server kept telling us 'it'll arrive in a few more minutes'.  All in, we waited 45 minutes for noodles that never came\n\n#3:  Service personnel were more interested on selling beer and wine to patrons than serving food \n\nI know what you're thinking- It must've been the hot spices that contributed to his anger and bad review on Mala.  Answer: Nah fool, it was because i was treated like a clown.\n\nDo not spend you're money here.  WE THE PEOPLE DEMAND REFORM!","475":"I'm at a loss for words; not because I can't think of any, but because my whole mouth is numb. Sichuan peppers make your mouth go numb, and it's actually really fun. Somehow it brings out the flavor in other foods, and flavor of the food here is spicy beyond description. And incredible. I got the dan-dan noodles, because I like the name, and everyone else said to. They're a must-try. I also got the spicy crispy chicken, which had a roughly 1:1 ratio of screaming hot chili peppers to bite size delicious pieces of chicken (see pics). It had me sweating behind the ears, but I finished it. \n\nThere are tons of really interesting things on the menu, and the waiters were happy to explain the things I didn't know about, which was basically everything. Many interesting selections of intestines and tendons: my kind of place.","476":"This place is supposedly the most popular Chinese food according toning of my friends. The food IS good, but I don't think that it's very authentic. The flavor are similar to high end Chinese good though! I had the orange chicken and Kung pao chicken. Both very delicious. They're usually pretty busy too! Service is ok, and they take card!","477":"I came to Mala for lunch with bunch of colleagues to celebrate Chinese New Year and disappointed to find out their food quality dropped dramatically. \nNo mention I specifically asked waiter if it takes long time to cook fresh whole fish, he said it only takes 5-10 minutes, so I ordered the fish and we waited for two and half hour, he come back saying that they only have two chefs at the time so they forget to cook the fish. Oh cool story bro, thanks for ruin my New Year's good fortune dish, if I won't be able to \"Nian Nian You Yu\", guess who am I going to blame???!!! \nWe ordered full table of food and they all taste below the average, boiling beef is not fresh and taste bland, duck dish taste way too salty and lack of peppercorn flavors, other dishes like pork saut\u00e9ed with tofu, ma PO tofu has no taste neither. Food quantity is too small that I felt I'm not in Chinatown anymore. Chef of the day is definitely not a Sichuan cuisine expert as nothing meets the basic Sichuan food standard.","478":"Our exploration of Houston's chinatown started here, after several recommendations of Mala Sichuan.  \n\nReally good sichuan in a friendly environment (not always true, I've found, with less expensive-more authentic chinese restaurants).   I enjoyed the spicy eggplants and the red oil dumplings, but like many other people thought the Dan Dan Noodles was a star dish.  Would love an opportunity to test out the more fiery dishes here; it seems like they can pack a real punch, judging from other yelps.","479":"For a china town restaurant, the service here is legit. The staff is friendly, swift, and very attentive. The restaurant itself is pretty small and spacing is a bit compact, but they do have I believe two sort of private rooms.\n\nThe price here is pretty fair with dishes ranging from 3-16 dollars (mainly 8 dollars a dish) We tried a couple of dishes, mainly spicy ones. I was shocked that it really didn't provide me with the \"Hey waiter! I need water\" kind of spice. It was more oily for my liking. Alot of the dishes were seasoned well, it was just really too oily for me, but I think thats just how the cusine style is.\n\nLoved the hot oil dumplings, the signature water boil fish was good, Dan Zai noodles i just realized is basic, The kung pao chicken was better than most, The pork and bamboo made me feel healthy, the vegetable dishs were good with the garlic, special spicy chicken was meh, prob will just try regular next time, would like to come back to try the mapu tofu","480":"First time here but I've heard pretty good things about this place. My group and I ordered the dan dan noodles, the spicy eggplant, the bacon appetizer with cucumber, pig liver, and spicy crispy chicken. \n\nThe dan dan noodles were very tasty and the eggplant had really good flavor. The bacon appetizer was my favorite because it was submerged in garlic oil. It was served cold so it was a very good contrast to the spicy dishes. The liver and chicken were my least favorite. For the chicken, it felt like I was just eating the crispy skins- there was no chicken. The breading seemed a little stale. It was also too spicy for my liking. The pigs liver... was just pigs liver. Nothing special. \n\nI was a little apprehensive at first because my spice tolerance is really low- but I was just fine here. The menu tells you how spicy their dishes are so you know what you're getting into. \n\nI'll be back !","481":"Getting here and parking here is probably the worst thing about Mala Sichuan Bistro.  \n\nDecor - I saw a few dates here, but it's not somewhere you take someone to impress them with great design. It's very clean, no unbussed tables. \n\nService - was fine.  They greeted me and seated me on arrival.  Questions were asked an answered.  \n\nThe food. My two favorite Chinese cuisines are Xi'an and Sichuan.  Xian for the use of lamb, and Sichuan for Ma La, the spicy and numbing flavors courtesy of a distinct peppercorn. Hopefully more people learn about the almost infinite variety of Chinese.\n\nI can't speak with authority on what are the classic Sichuan dishes, but I've been to a half dozen at home.  Dan Dan noodles are a standby, as are wontons and dumplings in red oil.  I went with Dan Dan noodles this time.  The other pictures on Yelp make the bowl look small.  It's actually a fairly large bowl, more.than 6 inches in diameter.  Noodles, green onions, ground pork, and a delicious sauce came together in.a way not so unlike Italian arrabiata pasta (angry..and possible spelling mistake)\n\nThe main.dish was Mala roasted prawn.  Now I grew up with heat, but it's a new world heat.  Scotch Bonnet peppers and habaneros. This is Old World heat, maybe not Indian hot, but heat nonetheless.  The pepper and the numbing effect plus the garlic and green onions...nirvana...no wait Shangri La.  Note to the wise, the shrimp are served split shell.\n\nFor me this place compares very favorably with my favourite spots in NYC.  Very recommended.","482":"I love Sichuan food! So spicy! I love their boiled fish, cold noodles, green beans! If you want good spicy food, come here. They have friendly staff and it's always clean. I love it!","483":"Pretty yummy place if you're craving spicy food! My friend and I got the spicy red dumplings, the Dan Dan noodles, the eggplant win garlic sauce and the crispy duck! Everything was very tasty the favorites were the egg plant and the Dan Dan noodles although I have spicier versions, but this definitely satisfied my craving. I would definitely go back!","484":"It was good but usual nothing special for us to come all the way to Chinatown . Service was good but the dishes we expected were not good the ones we were looking for. Maybe next time we will order right stuff","485":"I split about 10 appetizers with five friends and they were all fantastic!  I wish I had taken notes on all that we ordered, but alas, I did not.  I'll try to remember...\n\nGarlic Bacon - really good, as other reviewers mentioned.\nMala Beef Jerky - nice and spicy with whole chunks of peppers.\nHot and Sour Tofu - this was my least favorite, as it had a bit of a weird taste to it\nRed Oil Dumplings - delicious!\nHot and Sour Soup - amazing and complex flavor.  The fungus had an interesting texture that some were a little put off by, but I really enjoyed it.\nChilled Tofu Skin - really nice and simple appetizer.\n\nUnfortunately that's about all I remember.  We also got a spinach, chili and garlic dish that wasn't on the menu, and they definitely need to get it on there...so good!\n\nThe food came out quickly and the service was very friendly.\n\nFinally, the best part of the whole night was when the check came - for all of this food and five beers, the total after tax was $65.  We all left supremely stuffed.\n\nPro tip: 5% cash discount.","486":"Never disappoints... We always come here whenever we want to eat spicy food... Our favorite dishes are spicy crispy chicken , mala pot boiled fish and red oil rabbit..","487":"This has been on my \"list of places for try\" for quite some time and I finally had the chance to go try it out. What an awesome meal! Now, I'm disappointed in myself for not having tried it way earlier!! We got to try a bunch of different items and every single one was delicious.  The items we tried included: Hot and Sour Soup (great taste and big portion. One order is enough to share for a group of 4), Red Oil Dumplings, Dan Dan Noodles, Spicy and Crispy Chicken, Cumin Beef, and Mala Whole Roasted Tilapia.  We pretty much loved every dish and ate everything family style.  We would probably try a new Beef dish and a different whole roasted tilapia on our next visit.  These were solid 4\/5 options but the others were all 5\/5! This will be a spot to put in our regular rotation so I'm looking forward to trying even more items from the menu.\n\nA couple comments for people looking to try this place for the first time.  The food in general is spicy, oily, and salty.  I can see how this may be a restaurant some people may love but others might not enjoy as much if they are into healthy eating or don't like spicy food. I didn't really care for the bottle of Red Wine we had ($40). Might just bring our own bottle next time and pay whatever their corking fee is.","488":"I will go back here if I plan to visit Houston...very unique & different taste from China...","489":"I went here with a group of 10 folks Friday lunch time, place was half full. They offered me a separate meeting  room for lunch with an additional charge of 150$, 150 extra!!! Really just for having a simple team lunch. I declined the offer and suggested that we can sit in 2 separate tables 5 per table. The restaurant person was adamant and wanted us to sit in the separate room and asked us to pay compulsory minimum gratuity of 20% declining the idea of 2 separate tables with a reason that it is reserved; hearing this I told him good bye and just left the place with a decision that will never return here.","490":"This place gets very high reviews and I can see why, but I hold the mentality that you shouldn't wait in line at a restaurant - no food is worth the time. The food is good, but wasn't mind blowing? Eh! But what do I know, it's rated as one of Houston's top 100 restaurants by Allison Cook.  Maybe I had super ridiculous high expectations for this place based on ALL the other reviews.  All reviews for this place made it seem like it was the ULTIMATE place to go. I ordered the following:\n\n-Pork wrapped cucumber app\n-Crispy chicken\n-Tofu delight\n-Shredded pork w\/ bamboo in spicy garlic sauce\n\nThe pork wrapped cucumber cold appetizer was delicious and each piece was a perfect bite size.  However the sauce it was sitting in had a lot of oil, and after 5 pieces I had to stop. \n\nThe crispy chicken was probably why I ranked it a 3, it was quite disappointing - perhaps a bad batch? There was way too much breading, that coated tiny slivers of chicken. Way too salty to the point you couldn't recognize you were eating chicken.\n\nTofu delight was a bit more on the bland side, I wish they put more salt in this dish as opposed to the crispy chicken.\n\nShredded pork was pretty delicious - best dish of the night.  I wish I had more of this dish! I've ordered shredded pork with bamboo at several different Chinese places, and this place cooks and presents the dish very differently. Loved it, tasted perfect - spicy! Pork was perfectly seasoned and bamboo done just right. \n\nOverall, I would come back if any of my friends want to go. I wouldn't discourage anyone from not going, and if you're curious - just do it.  The service is quick, no frills and has a nice Chinese restaurant look and feel. I also loved the attention to detail where the waiters\/waitresses were wearing hot pepper pins.","491":"Really authentic Sichuan cuisine, two thumbs up. The Crispy Spicy Chicken and Dan Dan noodles are a must. Come prepared to eat lots of rice. Service is friendly and expect a wait during peak hours. Accepts credit card.","492":"First off...parking in this strip mall is TERRIBLE.  Drivers are extremely inconsiderate and pretty unskilled.  Not only do you have to wait around and stalk outgoing patrons for a parking spot, but you have to wait in line behind cars to do so!  \n\nAnyways, the place was packed for a Saturday lunch.  Since I had to wait like half an hour for parking, I got to my table late.  My friends had already ordered, and we were doing family style.  I'm not exactly sure what the dishes were called, but we had a couple orders of eggplant, water boiled fish, Dan Dan noodles, some crispy pork dish, and twice-cooked pork.  To be perfectly fair to this place, I'm not a huge fan of spicy, sichuan food.  I didn't particular enjoy a lot of the dishes because it's just not my style.  Everything was either very spicy, or very salty.  However, the twice-cooked pork and eggplant were delicious.\n\nThe service was OK, but they seemed very eager for us to leave since they had a good amount of people waiting to be seated.  This one waiter kept stopping by our table to ask if we were done, even though I was still clearly eating.  It got to be a little obnoxious.  Price isn't bad....about $15\/person for a very filling meal.","493":"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place! I mean this is our favorite Sichuan place in H-town... And I like their wall of dishes 0-0\n\nWas first referred here be friends who have been in Houston for a long time, and we fell in love with this place. We almost like every dish we've tried. Most of the dishes are authentic, like the boiling fish pot, Country Style Blood Curd Dish, and Twice Cooked Pork. Also we like the cold dish appetizers a lot: couple's lung slices (don't freak out by the name, it's just beef...) and garlic bacon are our favs. If you're familiar with Sichuan dish, don't order the American Chinese stuff, go for the authentic Sichuan dishes, you won't be disappointed here.\n\nWill keep coming back!","494":"I love this place!!!\n\nIf you ever went to asia cafe in Austin, they have spicy fish that's just as good!\n\nWe also tried the bacon cucumber appetizer and it was unexpectedly good and not that spicy!\n\nI also really enjoyed the eggplant dish. It was super hot, not that spicy, and super flavorful. \n\nSkip the non spicy dishes, the pork we ordered was not good.","495":"This is our go to place for authentic Chinese food. DON'T come here looking for fried rice or lo mein!\n\nWe pretty much have our favorites and get them all the time:\n\nCrispy spicy chicken 4\/5\nEggplant in garlic sauce 5\/5\nSpicy boiled fish!! 5\/5\nAnd a new one for us is the Dan Dan Noodles! 4\/5\n\nPoint is, go, stuff your face and live happily ever after. You can thank me later","496":"Cool place tucked away in the heart of Asian cuisine!  Be prepared to experience some \"kick\" in your food.","497":"Spicy! \n\nWe ordered to go: \n**Note**: Everything is a bit greasy (not a bit...it is) and all pretty spicy! \n\n- Water Boiled Fish : There is a reason why this is their signature dish! Expensive compared to everything else but worth it! The fish is so tender and falls apart in your mouth. \n- Cumin Beef : Enjoyed the different spice. Really brings a different element of flavor to traditional asian dishes. \n- Dan Dan Noodles : Lots of reviews love this dish. It was \"ok\" for me. It was nice to eat the noodles with the other dishes as a starch. A little spicy but nothing too bad. Sort of just bland and oily. It's a really cheap dish, so doesn't hurt to try it for yourself. \n- Mapo Tofu : I love mapo tofu! I always get this dish at every Chinese restaurant...seriously. This mapo tofu has a spicy kick (like every other dish at this restaurant). Delicious as a side dish to compliment the rice. \n\nThe family really enjoyed this place! We would definitely come back to try many of their other lip-smacking, spicy-looking dishes.","498":"It's good for formal lunch place with colleagues. Make sure u go there by 11 or be prepared to wait. Food is  & 5*. We always go with Crispy spicy fried chicken with garlic boiled fish. I love the combination on both ends of spectrum of deep fried to boiled.","499":"We ordered two appetisers. They were good. A bit slow bring the food but it was hot and the noodles were fresh- not frozen and reheated. Fresh noodles were well seasoned in the chili oil- it tasted good.","500":"Came here for lunch...from looking at the menu prices lunch is the way to go here.\n\nI recommend getting the funky stick chicken which is a cold dish appetizer, it is mildly spicy but does give you that numbing sensation in your mouth after a couple of bites.\n\nI ordered the Chengdu-style Prawns which I didn't really like or find unique.\n\nBe prepared for everything to be super oily.!","501":"As an ex-CIA agent, I can verify that this place is legitimate. It's even better than the Montrose location.","502":"Not a bad place to eat. It gets a little packed during lunch time but it's usually pretty good! I was a little disappointed with the dan dan noodles though. It was pretty plain and no flavor. Other than that, the fish fillet was pretty good!","503":"I was craving for spicy food and I was in the neighbohood so I decided to give this place a try. I ordered the Spicy Oil Dumpling and Mala Beef, Oil Dumpling, 5\/5, it was YUMMMY! Mala Beef, Spicy as HECK! I was sweating about 1\/4 way through and I eat very spicy! It was great!\n\nLove the food and service is great. If you pay cash, you get 5% discount. \n\nI will be back.","504":"I mainly like their steamed fish. I only go there for the fish, but not for anything else. Spinach with some garlic flavor was good. Pretty good service!","505":"We knew this was a good choice when we first entered the restaurant and saw that the clientele was mostly Chinese folks.\n\nThe water boiled spicy fish was outstanding.  Very tender flounder in a flavorful spicy sauce.  My kids shared a combination chow mein, and clamored for a second one to be ordered immediately.  We also got a plate of sauteed snow pea greens that were DIVINE.  \n\nI am sad to be leaving Houston and its fabulous Chinatown tomorrow.  I will dream of my next visit, and look forward to coming back to Mala Sichuan.","506":"I am very surprised that nobody has yet to review this place.  I know it's relatively new but still it should have at least a couple reviews by now.  I guess yelpers need to work harder here in Houston.\n\nAnyway, my husband's colleague told us about this place and said it served pretty decent and authentic Sichuan food.  Spicy Chinese food is always my priority and so far I can't say that I ain't disappointed in Houston.  I went to a couple Sichuan restaurants here but one was just bad and the other was only edible.\n\nSo we went tonight at 9:30pm.  It was a Monday night and late so we were the only customers there.  The people were very tentative and helpful when it came to ordering.  We wanted the Dan Dan noodles and string beans and the guy recommended the whole fish in spicy oyster sauce (or something like that).\n\nDan Dan noodles $3.95 were excellent!  The owner told me that they made their food relatively light  because most customers here can't take real Sichuan food (sad, isn't it?). So if you are into spicy food, make it very clear to them and they are happy to customize for you. I told them very spicy and still they were a little conservative. Anyway, the texture of Noodles were perfect and flavor was good.  The owner told me that they have them specially made and cooked.  \n\nThe string beans and bamboo shoots with pickles $7.95 was also good but they didn't put any peppers into (guess this was a non-spicy dish).  We will have to ask them to put dry peppers next time (that's the only right way to make it spicy).  However, this dish is usually very greasy but they managed to control the grease level so that it was refreshing.\n\nThe whole fish $16.95 was the main dish. It came buried in peppers but still not spicy enough for me.  I will just have to ask for extra extra extra spicy next time.  The fish was fried and then braised in sauce. The meat was very moist and fresh and the taste was good.  It wasn't my favorite fish dish (which is just too hard to compete) but it was decent  enough that I would order it again.\n\nThe decor was very clean and nice but the prices were ok. The whole fish was a little expensive but the rest of the dishes were reasonable.\n\nI was too hungry and too distracted by the food to take pictures this time.  So I need to make a mental note to slow down in my next visit (which I assume won't be far away) in order to show some pictures.","507":"Food was good, though a bit over-priced for the amount ($30 per person for spicy chicken, stir fry spinach and Dan Dan noodles). Service was typical of China town. The waiters and waitresses first spoke to me in what I assumed was Chinese, and after finding out I only looked Asian but didn't speak a word of their language, they ignored me and let in a family who came after me.","508":"Really great food! The Dan Dan Noodles are amazing. And the portion for the price ($4 I think) is not a \"snack portion\"...got that, the Shredded Pork in Garlic Sauce and the Crab and Asparagus soup with a friend and couldn't finish it all.\n\nNote: they seem to offer 5% off if you pay cash. Good to know for future trips. It's a little hard to find right now with the construction on Bellaire but it's worth the search.","509":"Spicy crispy chicken and crispy Mala beef is amazing! Get some greens with it and rice.. great combo!","510":"Dish sizes are kinda on the smaller size for what you're paying for, but the flavor can't be beat. Tried a TON of dishes, most of which were deep red from Sichuan pepper (careful not to eat one!). If you want their best offerings, be sure to order their Sichuan specialties. Favorites were the fried cuttlefish with basil (HOLY CRAP AMAZING. ended up ordering 2 of them because we ate the first dish so fast!) and the cumin lamb (cumin beef is on the menu, but they'll make it with lamb if you ask; super flavorful and tender meat). You will not regret your meal here =) Also the bathrooms were really clean - a diamond in the rough in Chinatown.","511":"Had the peppered chicken and the house special fried rice. Both dishes were excellent. Had mixed expectations when I walked in and definitely walked out with all of my expectations exceeded.","512":"I'm not a fan of Sichuan style food, but Mala was a whole different story. The owners are former UT Graduates so I already came in liking the restaurant. \n\nMy mouth was extremely numb for most of the meal, and I was sweating like crazy, but it was worth it. Make sure to order a can of wang lao ji to help calm the spiciness. Dan Dan Noodles and ma po tofu (cliche I know) are the best items on the list. If you are willing to venture out, their menu offers a variety of dishes such as rabbit and lung. \n\nMala will go far because of great service, and food!","513":"We had quite a few satisfying and happy meals here at Mala Sichuan Bistro....until.....we saw a big fly in one our dishes!!! I found out the fly at the end of our meal which by then it was too late and thankfully we didn't get stomachache!  We didn't dogbag any of the leftover home with us. \n\nI had read reviews here mentioned about roaches and flies in the food, I just didn't think...it would ever happen to us and it did!!! YUCKS!!!!!!!!!!\n\nThe restaurant looks clean. The kitchen's hygiene is questionable!!! Not sure when I will be able to look past this incident and give this restaurant another try!","514":"Second time here and it didn't disappoint -- both times were lunch hour. First time was on a Thursday and this time on a Monday. Thursday was jam packed and service was slow. Today, Monday, was dead dead dead. We had the place practically to ourselves!\n\nFirst time, we had Spicy and Crispy Chicken and Shredded Pork in Spicy Garlic Sauce. The chicken was good, but half the plate was red peppers, which aren't edible as much as I love eating peppers. It reminded me of dry buffalo wings with a hint of heat. Nothing to write home about, but good nevertheless. The Shredded Pork was excellent, scrumptious and will be a repeat.\n\nToday, we started off with Red Oil Dumplings and main course was Water Boiled Beef and Mala Beef Tofu. Dumplings had a great, great flavor, but very little filling. The flavor made up for the lack of filling big time. Both the other dishes were good, but after the flavor of the dumplings, it seemed lacking of equally good flavor.\n\nRegardless, we'll keep going back. It's a good strong place. Might not be the greatest, but certainly good!","515":"Probably the best Chinese food I've eaten. Food great. Some of the waitstaff were a little less than friendly.","516":"The spicy eggplant. This dish. I love eggplant. I love eggplant like whoa. This is one of the best eggplant dishes I've ever had. \n\nWe had a large party and they served us quickly and brought the food out swiftly. The giant lazy susan in the middle of the table makes sharing an enormous amount of food a lot easier. \n\nDespite being one of the house specialties, the tea leaf duck... is not worth ordering. It's just... not quite what you want. \n\nThey served cumin lamb that day, but unless you read Chinese you would never know. The specials are listed only in Chinese. \n\nThe spicy and crispy chicken was pretty much spot on. The boiled fish was really really good, but so messy to try to eat and to warn those -- there are bones in the fish! \nThe couples lung is a beef tendon dish that's got a sourness to it and tasty. And the bok choy needed for the sake of something green was also nicely cooked and tasty. \n\nDefinitely will be back. For at least the eggplant and the spicy and crispy chicken. Sooooo soooo good","517":"Went on Sunday - parking lot was completely packed and we waited about 15 mins for a table, but it was DELICIOUS.  We're not super adventurous so I can't comment on any of the more unusual dishes, but the Kung Pao, Cumin Beef, and Dan Dan Noodles were amazing.  We will be back!","518":"Great SICHUAN restaurant! Spicy crispy chicken, crispy chicken, saut\u00e9ed potato dry fried double veggies shredded pork in Beijing bean sauce. All very delicious! Also the red oil dumplings.","519":"If you want to operate a niche restaurant in the cutthroat arena that is Houston's Chinatown, then you better be the best at it, or else learn how to be very quickly. Fortunately for the rest of us, Mala Sichuan Bistro offers undoubtedly the best Sichuan food that Houston has to offer, and therefore, is easily a go-to place any time you're in the mood for a numbingly spicy experience.\n\nFirst of all, Mala is obsessed with their signature red oil sauce, which they drizzle on dozens of their dishes. It is a must try. So start with the red oil wontons, which soak up that oil very nicely, and then move on to the mapo tofu, a signature of Sichuan cuisine. Next, move on to the water-boiled fish, quite possibly one of the most classic dishes of all time.\n\nFinish off with the crispy chicken, which is jammed with peppers to your heart's content. But above all, try the kung pao chicken, just to appreciate the vast difference between a Chinese classic and its Americanized counterpart.\n\nIn all, Mala executes all of the classic Sichuan dishes almost flawlessly. Yes, the dishes don't get very spicy, but the customers seem to like it better that way, and the food will still numb your tongue with all that aniseed cooked inside. And yes, all that red oil will soak into your bloodstream, so make sure to get plenty of exercise afterwards.\n\nEither way, come prepared for great food, with great service, in a great atmosphere. The staff is efficient, attentive, and clearly above par for Chinatown. The inside is clean and the decor is comfortable. But above all, and I can't stress this enough, the food is rockin'.","520":"I came here for a big family meal. We came on a weekend evening with a large group without a reservation and it wasn't too busy. I'm not sure they spoke a lot of English; our Chinese friends did the talking and ordering. We went with the menu for eight with some substitutions. \n\nWhat I remember most about the experience is that the food was spicy and there were red peppers everywhere. We tried the cold appetizers couples lung slices of cold beef tendon and tripe and jellyfish salad. The crab and asparagus soup was good. We had a beef dish that seemingly had equal parts beef and red peppers. \n\nThe restaurant is decorated traditionally, but with a more clean, modern look. Not frilly. We got a small room (one of those things where they pull out dividers) for our party of 11. The service was fast. Accepts credit cards.","521":"LOVE THE FOOD. AUTHENTIC!!! GOOD PRICE!!!! \nIf you like spicy Chinese food, this is the place to go! \nThis is one of my fav places in Houston chinatown - quick, good, cheap. parking is easy - there's really nothing to complain. \n\nLOVE: Dan Dan Noodles, and all their fish dishes.","522":"So delicious. Fast, fresh, friendly. Spicy in a subtle way. Never felt like I was about to catch fire and we did the 3 pepper spicy. The water boil fish was incredible. Not five star just because there was a little too much oil, but it won't keep me from returning.","523":"This place is your typical Chinatown restaurant with crowded table space and high volume from all the talking. Expect lines on the weekends but the wait wasn't to bad when we came on a Saturday.\n\nThe food is decently priced and some food came almost instantly. Obviously that means it wasn't made to order or they just expect a lot of the same things being ordered. It still came out hot so I wasn't deterred. We ended up ordering 5 dishes.\n\nRed oil dumplings - YUMMY! This dish wasn't spicy and I really liked the red sauce it came with. I thought there was too much skin to filling but I still liked it. The filling wasn't anything special but the sauce worked well with it.\n\nDan Dan Noodles - I really liked this noodle dish and it was a lot bigger than I thought it would be. You need to make sure to mix the whole dish before eating it so the sauce distributes over all the noodles. The sauce gave off a nice nutty flavor to the dish.\n\nEggplants in Spicy Garlic Sauce - I'm in love with the purple vegetable known as eggplant so I definitely couldn't pass this dish up. The dish came out piping hot and was a little too hard to eat at first. After it cooled down, this was probably my favorite dish of the night. They were very nice and tender, and the sauce worked very well with the dish.\n\nCumin Beef - Strong cumin flavoring and the beef were very tender. A nicely well down dish.\n\nNorthern Boiling Fish - My least favorite dish of the night. This is a whole tilapia fish cut up in a big pot of oil. The fish came out nice a tender but I didn't think the fish got much of the flavoring. I wasn't to impressed with this dish and I don't know why many people do. \n\nOverall I enjoyed the place and definitely will be back.","524":"Good prices, a ton of food and a friendly staff. The garlic bacon rolls with cucumbers and the red hot oil dumplings are good to start off with. The spicy crispy chicken was disappointing this time but the water boiled beef was good.","525":"Went here Saturday and enjoyed an excellent, spicy meal. We saw a line outside as we parked. I walked into the crowded and small store and put my name down on the list. There were 5 tables in front of us and we waited about 20 minutes - not bad. \n\nSome of the food came almost instantly after ordering so definitely not cooked to order. I don't think this affected the quality too much though. It was still piping hot. \n\nHere is what we ordered:\n\nCumin Beef - very tender. Texture is not really like beef but tastes very beefy with a strong cumin and onion flavor. Really good. \n\nEggplant in garlic sauce - burning hot at first so couldn't enjoy it. As it cooled, the slightly soft and salty texture and taste was awesome. Very well cooked eggplant. \n\nWater boiled tilapia - comes in a big pot of oil. It's fish filets but the bones with meat are also in there. Comes with noodles, and cabbage, both of which soak up the flavors of the oil well and are delicious! The fish was very flaky and perfect. \n\nRed oil dumplings - The red sauce is quite salty so don't put too much of it. It does compliment the dumpling well in moderation. The pork filling is standard but good. The ratio of dumpling skin to filling is way too high. Pass on this one. \n\nDan Dan noodles - the portion size was bigger than what I thought it was going to be compared to the pics posted here. The noodles have a nice salty, nutty flavor. Kind of a simple description but was actually one of my favorite dishes of the meal.","526":"This place is good. Spicy chicken is really covers by chill but it is so tasty!  It is aged dry chill they are using. I am not too keen about their Dan Dan men. I am not liking the noodle they are using. I think, this is a personal choice but everything is good! I like their veg dish. Iike cucumber and wintetmelon dishes.","527":"Really good food. I liked everything I have had here. Spicy but not super hot. Water boiled fish and the string beans are my favorite. All the whole fish that I have had here are delicious. Haven't had the Dan Dan noodles but can't wait to try them","528":"Great place! A group of us went and decided to do family-style. We ordered at least 6 items and everyone had a little of each. The eggplant is rave-worthy. My personal favorite was the Mala crispy beef. Dan Dan noodles were good, but not amazing. Red oil dumplings were fantastic. It was a great meal overall. \n\nThe place is small, but we didn't have to wait long to get seated on a Saturday night. The prices are very affordable!","529":"Went here for lunch with my mom. Despite all the fanfare, I felt that the food was pretty average for Chinatown, but the service was pretty terrible. I understand that they were busy, but the waitress began to help another table while we ordered food. \n\nWe left a less than average tip for the worse than average service (even in Chinatown, where people don't usually give any tip whatsoever), and a waitress followed us out of the restaurant to tell us that they expect at least 15% tip from all customers. She the proceeded to ask us for money. Seriously? Who does that?\n\nDefinitely never coming back again.","530":"This place is addictive -- we come here once per week because we crave that Mala spice. Order the dry fried chicken, the cucumbers and the green beans (we order these without pork and it's delicious)!!!","531":"It's hidden right in the middle of a strip mall in the Bellaire area.  I usually have no problem eating spicy dishes but I was sweating by the end of the meal.  Don't get me wrong it was delicious and flavorful but spicy.   So if you don't know about Sichuan cuisine better learn quick before trying it out.  \n\nYou get a 5% discount for paying cash.  \n\nDefinitely must try the Dan Dan Noodles!  Everything is very oily and delicious.  You can have everything from pork, fish, and chicken to blood and organ dishes you won't find everywhere.  \nIf you enjoy spicy fare swing by if you are in the area and try it out.","532":"Mala Bistro's dishes are simply delicious. Their service was also very good for Chinatown's standards. Despite the small space they occupy, the whole restaurant was very quiet even when it's almost completely full.\n\nI was going to give them five stars until our experience this past weekend. The last time we went to Mala Bistro we noticed they have three private rooms which seat about 8-10. We thought they would be great for larger groups as their main seating area is a bit cramped.\n\nWe invited some of our friends to have lunch with us since we loved Mala Bistro's dishes so much. However, when we requested for the room, the waitress told us that there is a minimum amount of $150. The amount isn't extremely unreasonable. From my quick calculations, with 10 people, we COULD spend up to $150 after taxes and tips. However, the minimum requirement did catch me by surprise. Although slightly taken aback, I was still considering getting the room.\n\nJust as I was still considering, the waitress noticed my hesitation and said that the table they have outside is the same size as inside the room. That's when I decided to take my business elsewhere. They just don't get it, we didn't want the room because we thought the table was bigger. It was more private and roomier! I told her as such politely and she gave me this look like she doesn't understand why privacy and having your own space important. By the way, none of their three rooms were even occupied and their meaning area was crowded. That's when I just said thank you and left.\n\nSo bottom line, if you ever wish to use one of their rooms, be ware of the $150 minimum spending limit. But if you don't need to use their rooms, I'd still recommend Mala Bistro just based on my previous experiences.\n\n---\n\nA somewhat interesting note, Mala Bistro is the only restaurant in Chinatown that is part of the Southwest Dining Reward program. However, to earn rewards, it requires you to use your credit card but you get 5% discount if you pay with cash.","533":"Very good food:-) I am such a huge fan of here. this is the best szechuan restaurant in houston so far.  I have gone there many times. they never let me down. it is pretty clean restaurant. much better than other szechuan restaurant in chinatown. yesterday i stopped there with my close friends. he came from szechuan province of china. he thought food was very tasty too. we ordered signature noodles, kung po chicken. both very perfectly good in my way. every time i got signature noodles in there. they always make it really special. i cant taste the same in the other places. kung po chicken was almost like chinese style.\n\ni should give here 5 stars. but i took one off. sorry, cuz i have a highly expectation to here. i hope you can be better and better.  and i wish you can add more kinds of foods. i saw the menu cross out many food but never adding more. I feel a little bit sad. sometimes  i really wanna order the food you cross out but i can't. most of crossed out food are very regular chinese food. i dont know why they can't make it. that is the only thing i want you to improve. adding some new dishes. i will go there more often:)","534":"My absolute favorite Chinese restaurant in Houston! It's quite a drive for us, but so worth it! The tingling \/ numbing feeling you get from their spices is kinda weird yet addicting, if it bothers you, enjoy your meal with a beer or a soda. I've been to the westheimer location, although trendier, i find the portions, prices, and food so much better at the original, Bellaire location. There are so many other dishes we have yet to try and I cannot wait for our next visit. Must haves--crispy, spicy chicken, mapo tofu, sliced bacon with vegetables, and the cucumber salad \/ appetizer. yum, yum!","535":"Love the crispy spicy beltfish appetizer. I was expecting it to be hot, but it is served cold and that was a pleasant surprise. My girlfriend told me she was going there during a recent trip to Houston and I specifically requested that she bring me a to-go order of the beltfish all the way back to Austin. The eggplant and the boiled fish are also very good. Can't wait to go back and try more of their food.","536":"OMG. I love this place. I'm not an expert on Chinese food, but I love Sichuan, and this was the best I've had. The Three Pepper Beaten Duck was one of the most delicious, spicy things I've eaten. Look at this description:\n\n\"This half duck is marinated, smoked with tea leaves, simmered with spices, fried, and finally vigorously stir fried with red chilies, Serrano peppers, and whole Sichuan peppercorns\"\n\nMarinated, smoked, simmered, fried, and stir-fried. That's five kinds of cooking, in one $12.95 dish. And it was delicious. Americans might dislike all of the bones and bone fragments, but I think its worth it.\n\nHad another dish, dry fried double veggies, also delicious. Salty (due to the preserved vegetables in it, I think), and a great complement to the spicy heat of other sichuan dishes.\n\nI tried dandan noodles, because so many people yelpers mentioned them. But they weren't on the same level as these other dishes. It was a huge bowl, though, really an entree portion, for only $4.95.\n\nThe service was great, too. Very sweet and helpful waitresses.","537":"We have tried a number of dishes on the menu and have loved them all.  We love spicy foods, but what I love most about the dishes at mala is how they get the garlic to really explode into the flavor of the dish.  I high recommend the dishes with \"mala\" in the name.  The crispy mala beef is one of the most delicious things I have ever tasted.","538":"Food was excellent. I would have given 5 stars except there was one little thing that bothered me. My fiancee and i (he is filipino and i am white) were sitting at our table waiting for our food when a female waitress came up and took my chopsticks away BEFORE asking if i wanted a fork instead. She did not do this to my fiancee. Keep in mind that my fiancee doesnt know how to use chopsticks. I do however and prefer to use them even at home because thats just what im used to. My dad taught me at a VERY young age. She didnt take my fiancee's chopsticks away and offer him a fork at all when he needed one. I had to ask for my chopsticks back and my fiancee asked for a fork. Not all asian people use chopsticks. And there are definitely white people who do use chopsticks.\nNever take something away from someone because you make a racist assumption. Its okay to ask first but its not okay to take it away from one person just because of their race. Totally not cool.","539":"3.5? Take in mind I'm probably more critical of Sichuan food being a self appointed Sichuan food lover.\nI always grade Sichuan food first and foremost on the fuqi feipian since I love this appetizer. Sad. I couldn't find any thin beef slices and only saw beef tripey\/offal stuff. My momma always told me it should be equal unless the restaurant skimps. It was also way too mala where I wanted kill the taste instead of the pleasantly mind-numbing afterthought tickle.\nTheir boiled fish in oil is pretty delicious, although their bowl is somewhat smaller than some of the other places. But I also didn't go away feeling like I ate a pound of oil so win for that!\nI loved the vinegar chili sauce of the Chengdu Mung Bean Jelly.\nThe rest of the dishes were good, but nothing particularly stand out.\nShredded pork with bamboo shoots tasted healthy, but I was taken aback by lack of spice... I awkwardly thought all Sichuan food had strong tastes.\nDue to having little kids around, we had some shredded potato, dumplings, and some other non spicy food.\nDandan noodles had good taste, but also no kick.\nI have to say, food was maybe above average and definitely by no means bad and we finished it all. I guess I was having much higher expectations since I came after hearing that it was named in a James Beard award.\nPricing is fair. I would not come back for the fuqi feipian. Being newly transplanted back to Houston, I'd probably explore more Sichuan restaurants before coming back.\nService is very nice - they refill lots of water. We also broke a bowl and they gave the kids cute green plastic unbreakable dining ware.","540":"If you are into spicy delicious authenticity, this place is your jam! I first tried their specialties when a friend brought a few dishes in for dinner club. After that, I knew I needed to head to the restaurant one day to get it straight from the source. This is a great place for a work lunch because the service is super quick and the food isn't too saucy (so you won't accidentally ruin your good tops). My favorite dish is the mala beef, but everything I've tried so far I've fallen in love with.","541":"Spicy & crispy chicken here is, in my opinion, the best dish in Houston, and I've had a LOT of good dishes in this town. I never order less than 2 orders of it, and I usually order 4-5 because I constantly have people pestering me to pick some up for them. Other standouts include the sesame bamboo shoots (the mala version is absolute FIRE...the hottest thing I've had on the menu there) and dan-dan noodles. And I could eat the garlic, bacon, cucumber rolls all day long.\nOnly dish I had that I didn't like was the cumin beef, because it tasted too much like chili.","542":"Darn good place to go. I grew up eating Sichuanese cuisine, both my parents grew up in Sichuan\/Chongqing. My father especially loves to eat at this place, because they know how to cook their stuff.\n\nMala literally means numb and spicy, and that's what you are gonna get in all of their spicy dishes. There really isn't a 'degree' of spiciness, rather EVERYTHING is mala. Therefore EVERYTHING is delicious.\n\nMy go-to dish is the water-cooked beef. This restaurant actually gives you a good amount of meat relative to the cabbage unlike other places. The beef tripe cold dish is good as well. And if you don't know what to get, ask the waiter or another customer their preference.\n\nA small plus I would add, they offer a 5% discount by using cash. I absolutely HATE places that charge extra for using plastic (which is against Visa\/MC's terms) and this place is unlike all those other Chinatown places that do add a surcharge. So good for you Mala.\n\nIn terms of Sichuanese cuisine, Mala does it really well, if my father who cooks Sichuanese dishes chooses to eat here, and all our Chinese family friends consider him to be really good as well. Or just visit and let your stomach decide!","543":"I came here for Sunday lunch and I ordered spicy dumpling and pepper beef. They are authentic overall, but in the sense of poor street food in Chengdu. The dumpling wrapper is too thick, but the flavor is indeed very good. The beef lack flavor somehow. For sichuan food, I would still go to Chuan's.","544":"Great food (beef tendons\/Mala bamboo\/boiled beef) but I wish they would low the music down a little!!  It was just too loud!!","545":"This place has really good Dan Dan Noodles. The Water boiled fish is a must try. Don't let the 3 chili peppers on the menu scare you, it's actually not that spicy. Other dishes are yummy as well. Overall the food is good here , just need improvement with their service.","546":"Such a disappointment given the hype on Yelp! Food was 5\/10, and so not worth making me a special trip for. Seems like the other reviewers have never had decent Chinese food!","547":"A very authentic experience! Try the mala tilapia from their aquarium :)","548":"It's been an hour since I was at Mala Sichuan Bistro, and my face is still numb. For those who may not be familiar with Sichuan cuisine, the food is oily and contains ma la (most dishes), which is a Sichuanese peppercorn which gives you a weird, numbing sensation in your mouth. So if you're wondering why your taste buds are acting strange and regretting all the grease you're dumping in your system, just know that that's exactly what you signed up for. \n\nI ordered family style and had the huay guo ro (thin pork fillet), suay zhu yu pian (fish fillet in spicy sauce), wu gen zhan wan (intestines and tofo), and ma pou tofo. I would only recommend the ma pou tofo to those who like the numbing feeling you get with ma la and the wu gen zhan wan if you're feeling pretty adventurous. The huay guo ro and suay zhu yu pian are pretty safe Chinese dishes and very good.\n\nNow that I've stuffed myself, I'm going to lay down and let all this food turn into fat in my body.","549":"Everything I tried was soo good! If I were to go to this place 10 more times, I would order the same dishes and wouldn't get bored of food. I ordered the egg and tomato soup, eggplant garlic, Mala pot roasted tilapia, spicy crispy chicken. Try all of them. And watch out for little round spices in some meat dishes, they are super spicy and can give your tongue a numb feeling!","550":"Before I get to my review of the horrendous and disgusting Mala Chinese Bistro that 62 people on here think is good, let me do a sidebar with an overview of the Chinese places in Chinatown.\n\nCall me different. Call me picky. Call me unknowledgeable about Sichuan, szechuan or however the hell its spelled or written these days. I don't know why it happens, but only in Houston, and only in their veritable plethora of shitty Chinese joints do  I order a dish I am certain I know, and then when I get home and open up the container, it is nothing like what I thought I was ordering. \n\nI know what I am going to do from now on... I am going to open up every dish I order before I get home and find out I did NOT get what I ordered -- or that what I ordered is a disgusting pile of goo. \n\nEvery one of those joints in Chinatown has done this to me. And It chaps my ass that some of these Chinese places still call chow mein the stuff which is all noodles... I had ordered enough noodle dishes - thank you very much, and did not need another pile of noodles with some chopped up crap on top of it.... enough whining... to the review.\n\nHot and sour soup - pretty good as far as this standard dish goes.\n\nRed oil dumplings - very delicious. very good dumpling texture.\n\nDan Dan noodles - they're noodles... Big whoop.\n\nSpecial chow mein - they're noodles... Big whoop. ohhh wait, I just said that above.. see Dan Dan noodles for review of this dish. Ohh, and I thought I was getting chow mein with vegetables, not another noodle dish.\n\nCrispy  chicken - I took the rec of a few people I know and ordered this. It is little chicken pieces in some hot peppers... and it sucked... whoever thinks this dish is good most likely is a frequent visitor to Church's.\n\nDevourable beef pot  - The beef was pretty good but it was swimming in a sauce with some unidentifiable vegetables in it. I just wish I would have ordered a real beef dish and not some beef swimming in goo.\n\nAnd to add to the lackluster food that this place delivered, my friend and I both had raging headaches about five hours later. MSG, chemicals... who knows? but the overly salty and greasy food I am sure had something to do with that.\n\nI've had much better Chinese food in Lafayette, LA than at this place and at other places in Houston....and the Thai food in Lafayette, which IMO is a better and healthier cuisine in general than Chinese will blow away any Thai food that I have eaten in Houston, and especially all of those joints in Chinatown, most of which have a bathroom so vile that only a goat would be interested in using it.\n\nI am giving this place one star because of the greasy oily sewage they served as well as for the MSG  headache I received at 3AM... and that my friend received as well.  How 50 people or so gave this joint five stars boggles my mind. I have had better chinese food at several buffets than at this place... and I would NOT rate any of those buffets as gourmet chinese food.\n\nUntil I can get a good meal in Chinatown in a clean restaurant I am going to be very harsh in reviewing these joints... Bottom line... this place sucks, and if you think its good then you probably don't know the difference between chicken shit and chicken salad.... ohh, and to bolster my opinion here, a vietnamese lady I know who happens to own the best viet restaurant in Lafayette ate here last week and told me she thought it was gross... I rest my case.","551":"We've been branching out lately from our usually spots on bellaire and I was very interested in trying out some szechuan cuisine. We came with a 6 person group and ordered a lot of duck. Personally I am not a big fan of duck but everyone else is that came with me so thats what they all ordered. The overall consensus was that they all had a good flavor, but they didn't render out enough of the fat. I have no idea what the process is for preparing duck, so I can't really elaborate. What I can say is that the duck was a bit fatty and I just at around it. I can also say that I would have liked it better if the skin were crispier. \n\nMoving on from the duck, I ordered the Mala fried beef dish. It has a 3 chili rating. Not quite 3 chilis in my book but they may have toned it down for us. Dispite the less than optimal heat level, I found it to be very interesting. I don't eat a lot of szechuan pepper so the flavor is still very novel and I like it as a nice break from other chinese cooking. The beef had an amazing flavor and was a bit chewy like very tender beef jerky, as I expected. If you like the spice, I would give it a try.\n\nI also ordered the Dan Dan noodles becuase there were so many pictures on Yelp and I was very underwhelmed. They don't really have that much flavor and I didn't really see the point.\n\nThe Wontons were amazing though. They had a great testure and flavor and I would definitely suggest getting an order.\n\nWhen I want szechuan again, I'll definitely be coming back. I want to try some more dishes that you don't find at many other places.","552":"Tried the Mapu tofu and the fried chicken - awesome food - to die for. I will continue to go there","553":"Meh just meh\n\nOk so this place is popular and the lines are long they serve spicy food but I didn't expect the food to be covered by spice and oil so all you taste is just that! My friend from china says the food is great so maybe I ordered the wrong stuff I might give it another shot one day but based on the three dishes I tried I just couldn't finish any plate it's as if someone tried to cover bad cooking with hot peppers so all you taste is the heat not the meat! Anyone can do that.","554":"I have visited here a few times and I am pleasantly surprised by the consistency of the food. The last time we came, my family ordered a spicy boiled beef, an eggplant dish, mao xue wang (spicy dish with a variety of veggies, noodles and meats), and a spicy fried chicken. \n\nThe flavor on everything was really good, although on the saltier side. I am a fan though since most of the chinatown restaurants have sacrificed quality and quantity. \n\nIt is quite clean and I am def. want to visit again. I don't think that I would wander off from the dishes that my family always orders, but if I just want some spicy Chinese food, this place would be a fine place to get some at for a decent price.","555":"Straight to the point: DISAPPOINTED. \n\nWe were very excited to try this place. After did my research, Mala's menu and pictures are overrated. \n\nWe have to give them thumbs up for being full house on Tuesday night. Restaurant is pretty big, clean, and funky decoration. Tables are way too closed to each other. The couple sat next to us always turning their heads and making comment in Chinese everytime we made comment on the food. Annoying. A second after we sat, our server stopped by and started speaking Chinese... Don't assume all Asian speak Chinese, especially when my husband is Caucasian. \n\nWe ordered pork kidney in red chili oil, the supposed to be great dandan noodle, tea smoked duck, surf clam and wonton in red chili oil. We were both agree on the best dish: pork kidney. Kidney was very tender and still have slight gamy taste, which I like. Red chili oil was far off from spicy. From scale one to ten, it was a two. Very disappointing for a Sichuan restaurant. Dandan noodle was oddly taste like peanut sauce with zero spiciness. Zero. Duck was OK, nothing special. Wonton was OK. Surf clam was OK. \n\nThe server was not attentive at all when it comes to refilling the drink, especially with the iced tea. My husband's iced tea has been pretty much empty all the time, I asked and pointed at her when she stopped by. She only refilled my water. Were they being cheap or what?! \n\nwe will definitely NOT coming back to this place. Totally overrated.","556":"Since I've been referred to this place, I try to make it a point to eat here every time I'm in Houston. Let. Me. Tell. You. I am a fan.\n\nVENUE: Your typical shoved-in-a-corner-of-a-shady-lot Chinatown staple. Expect lines, expect a bit of volume. Don't expect 5-start dining experience, you go for the food!\n\nFOOD: I always order the Cumin Beef - always cooked such it's tender and chewy. The first time I ate it, the bf and I thought we had ordered chicken. Flavored well, not spicy enough for me. You can't go wrong with the water spinach stir-fried in garlic. Nom nom.\n\nSERVICE: The staff is fluent in English, so don't be afraid my non-chinese speaking friends.","557":"Don't try to go here during lunch time hours because the plaza's parking lot SUCKS.  Drove around for a good 20 mins LOOKING for parking.  ANNOYING.\n\nMala pan roasted tilapia was a good dish... that's where I tasted the true sichuan flavor come out.\n\nDan dan noodles- make sure you mix everything up together to get the full effect.","558":"Went back and the food wasn't as great, Waited a while for food to get to the table and it wasn't even hot. Waitress was very rube when i didn't leave a tip, She even ran behind me when i left to ask for her tip. Don't really plan on going back.","559":"Mala Sichuan Bistro is hands down my favorite restaurant in Bellaire. The quality, flavor, and service are always excellent. This is as authentic as you get with Sichuan cuisine. My friends and I always order the same dishes when we go. We just love our usual combination. Sometimes if we have more people, we will also order other dishes. Everything is delicious!\n\nOur favorites:\nCouple Lung Slices \nSpicy Bean Noodles (usual dish: very refreshing cold appetizer)\nDan Dan Noodles\nWater Boiled Fish Filet \nFish Fillet and Sauerkraut Soup (usual dish: flounder filet and rice noodles)\nCumin Beef (usual dish: amazing flavor and tender meat)\nGarlic Stir Fried Baby Bok Choy (usual dish: best version in all of Bellaire)","560":"I walked in and saw the proprietor-lady taking out dried chilis. looked legit\n\nfood: freaking awesome..got the cold chili beef kidneys, dan dan noodles, and the beef lungs \"fuqi feipan\". \n\nthe kidneys tasted so clean and had a great texture, no gaminess. the dan dan noodles were pretty textbook, chewy noodles with spicy crack-like addicting sauce, and the fuqi feipan...man, so many textures, so amazing. \n\nthe level of spiciness is mild at first, but gets more intense per bite. so..ya, prepare to eat a lot of rice or drink a lot of water\/tea\/beer. \n\nsidenote...this is the first chinese restaurant that I've seen that had a beerlist with wittbeirs and ipas...anything import\/micro besides tsingtao and heineken. kinda left me speechless for a bit.\n\n\nim gunna have to come back for the larger dishes, but I'm pretty confident they're probably awesome as well.","561":"Delicious place to eat. Mala crispy beef is a must have. The dan dan noodles are scrumptious. I really enjoy dining here. Love to go and eat at places that are consistent with flavors.","562":"After reading through all 71 reviews, I'm surprised very little has been mentioned about the Top Notch Pot of the Outlaws.  I've tried most of their other stuff here already that everyone has described, so no need to repeat here on those.\n\nSichuan King has the best sichuan food in Houston, better than Mala Sichuan.  But the service at SK is so horrendous, Mala is the next best alternative and my go-to place for good sichuan cuisine.  After reading all the glowing reviews about Mala from 29-95, Houston Press, and NYT, I just had to try this place out.  Located at the old Sinh Sinh location in DiHo, the interior is pretty standard fare for any chinese restaurant in this area.  Service here is decent and certainly better than SK.  Sometimes the water comes out dirty (which unfortunately is on-par for most asian restaurants in SW Houston), so I always opt for the can of chilled Coke.  The menu has some pretty crazy names for the dishes, but the description below the poetic names are self-explanatory for the uninitiated.  I've ordered many of their authentic dishes and I find it peculiar that 66% of the time, their dishes are 5\/5 and 33% of the time, their dishes are 1\/5.  The poorly-rated ones always seem constantly contaminated with pork intestines flavor even if the dish has none in it.  If you love pork intestines or menudo, then you'll think this restaurant is 5-stars.  I'll often order 3 dishes b\/c I know one of them will taste horrible.  Probably wondering why I keep eating here then?\n\nTop Notch Pot of the Outlaws.  This is my favorite dish here.  This is the chief reason why I come back here.  Watching Anthony Bourdain and Andrew Zimmern whoop up on the nuclear-spicy Mala hotpots in Chengdu, this is a must-try for any restaurant that claims to be Sichuan.  The waiters bring out a portable heater and the pot of soup.  The broth is red and oily with a dash of evil.  It's filled with all kinds of meats: intestines, blood pudding, tripe, beef, squid, prawns, different types of mushrooms, bean sprouts, cabbage, spam, vermicelli, tofu, fresh tilapia, and bits of jalapeno.  Even though I order this hotpot all the time, the waiter keeps forgetting.  I ask for it tonight and he tries to discourage me from ordering saying it's very spicy and full of intestines.  Told him I've eaten this many times before, bring it!  The broth is very spicy, but manageable to eat (ie. not inedible).  The flavor in the broth comes from much of the spicy oils and peppers used for flavoring as well as all the meats cooked into it.  I'm not a fan of intestines and usually fish it out (reminds me of bad bacon).  The tripe, beef, and blood pudding are very tender and flavorful when soaked and infused with the mala broth.  The shrimp and tilapia are super-fresh.  You can tell by the way the meat still somehow manages to hold together in this fiery cauldron of liquid hell and by the freshness of the meat that comes out despite the overpowering broth.  The bean sprouts has a fresh nutty taste to it and the bok choy, while delish, has a difficult time balancing anything out in this pot.  With everything buried in the pot, forget about trying to fish out the vermicelli at the bottom, it's a losing proposition.  My wife loves the hotpot here mainly because she is able to eat it.  Personally, I wish it was more spicy.  I would like to see more peppers floating in the broth.  The absence of peppercorns floating in the broth is a bit disappointing (that's what makes mala cuisine numb and spicy (ie. ma - la).  While the flavoring is there, I feel maybe the spiciness is dialed back a bit for western tongues that can't handle it.  But the lack of DEFCON-5 (maybe just a DEFCON-3 here) is made up by the great flavor of the broth.  Would be nice too if they just gave us a pot full of spicy broth only and then order the meats and vegetables a la carte like what they do at Sichuan King and Little Sheep Mongolian Hotpot.  I would probably end up eating the same stuff minus the pork intestines.\n\nI want to give this place 5-stars, but I just can't.  Not spicy enough hotpot, too many bad dishes mixed with stellar dishes, dirty water.  But still pretty darned good enough to keep me coming back here for years with great service.","563":"What's all the fuss about?  I tried Mala last night based upon great reviews and I'm still wondering if I went to the same restaurant.  The service was terrible.  My food came out in the wrong order-appetizer last, almost when I had finished my meal (they obviously forgot about it), and the soup and main course came out together.  The hot & sour soup was terrible, not much flavor and no sour taste at all.  The Mala prawns were good, but there wasn't much else in the dish except a ton of chile pods and a little celery.  The best item was the belated appetizer, the Red Oil Dumplings, which were pretty good.  Not a very good value for the money.  I won't return.","564":"One of my favorite places to eat in chinatown!! The crispy mala beef and chicken are both delicious but, brace yourself, the peppercorns will leave you drooling...literally! I usually start with the west lake soup and add an order of dry fried double veggies to whatever meat or fish dish I'm into that day. They get super packed on weekends but I usually go after work around 5:30pm on weekdays so it's not a problem for me :)","565":"Kung pao chicken, saut\u00e9ed beef and Mongolian beef were delicious! Waitresses are a little rude. You can only pay with 2 credit cards per table no matter how big the party is.","566":"I only get one thing when I go here, the House Special Spicy Chow Mein with shrimp. So delicious, portion is huge, I always take leftovers back for the next day and all for under $8! Service is quick but if you go during lunch time this place is always packed. Staff is friendly, great place!","567":"A friend who was visiting from Chicago wanted to meet for dinner before going back and we were both really wanting some Sichuan cuisine. We had also both heard and read really good things about Mala Sichuan Bistro and were looking forward to it!\n\nOn our dinner date, we were seated and ordered quite a few appetizers to share as well as entrees for ourselves - all in all, a good $50 worth of food. So my friend and I were busy catching up, the food was tasting pretty good (minus my Mala Pot Roasted Prawns, whose main flavor was unfortunately stuck on the prawn shells I had to remove one by one to eat)...and then, literally as we are not even close to midway through our meal, the most unbelievable thing happened...\n\n...our waitress had to the audacity to ask us to \"hurry up because we have other customers waiting...\"\nSCREECHING HALT to our dinner and conversation. My friend and I looked at each other, then her, and just were silently baffled. Then when she left our table, the bafflement became just pure anger. Never in the hundreds of restaurants we have dined in nationally and internationally have we EVER been asked to \"hurry\" our meal. There were plenty of other empty tables in the restaurant, so we were just plain confused and mad that we could no longer fully enjoy our meal. In fact, it made us want to either leave, or just eat even slower.\n\nThe next time she returned to our table, we asked to speak to her manager. Then, to our further dismay, she suddenly began shaking her head and saying, \"No, no, it's OK, it's OK.\" Of course, this was unacceptable and we still wanted to speak to the manager, so we went up ourselves and told him exactly what happened. We thought at least the manager could maybe do something to salvage our meal (although it was totally ruined anyway.) Instead, he replied, \"Oh she's new.\" No discount offered, no nothing. He spoke to the waitress, but we didn't hear what was said. We assume she did not receive the proper talk needed. No one in any sort of service industry would own up to this, but it happened. \n\nWe certainly don't recommend this restaurant to anyone. There are hundreds of other amazing restaurants in Chinatown - don't go to this one.","568":"My favorite Sichuan restaurant in Houston, hands down.\n\nIt looks super small on the outside, but inside it's very spacious. Don't be fooled!\n\nApparently all the chefs are from Sichuan. Being a girl born and raised in Chengdu, I find this fact absolutely delightful. \n\nFOOD:\nI've come to this restaurant about 4 times now, and every time, I try to order something new (other than some staple Sichuan dishes that I always get such as twice-cooked pork and mapo tofu and shui zhu beef = all really good btw). But ya, everything I ordered so far is so delicious! They even have spicy dou hua...!! It's so hard for me to write a review on a specific dish because everything here is really good. I guess I'll just list what are some dishes that I always get: \n\nTwice-cooked pork, mapo tofu, shui zhu beef, the 4-spicy starred fried chicken thingie, yu xiang eggplant, shuan ni bai rou, beef jerky as appetizer, chengdu cold noodles, spicy pork ears, snowpea leaves, water spinach, gan bian chicken. These are just a few of the items I usually get, but really, you can't go wrong.\n\nPRICE:\nReally reasonable. Remember that if you pay in cash, you get 5% back. So bring cash!!\n\nPARKING:\nCan be super crowded on the weekend due to the overflow of Chinese people doing grocery shopping at Jusgo next door. Come on a week night or come early on weekend lunch if you don't want to keep on circling around for parking.\n\nRESERVATIONS:\nThey take reservations for party of 8 or more.\n\nATMOSPHERE;\nIt's a typical Chinese restaurant, but it's really clean. A plus for that!\n\nSERVICE:\nWho cares? It's all about the food.\n\nFor all non-spicy food eaters, sorry...but this is a Sichuan restaurant. However, there ARE some non-spicy dishes for you....just not as good.\n\nI'm looking forward to taking all my friends who visit Houston to Mala Sichuan!","569":"I am 100% Chinese and I know that mala sichuan food is suppose to be spicy (and not the average spicy either, it is the mouth numbing spicy).\n\nThis place is one of my family's favorite place to dine.  I must agree that there are some dishes that are a bit salty, but it is not enough to fuss about it.  They are known for their fresh tilapia dishes, which they have a whole page on their menu dedicated to different preparations for tilapia.  The dan dan noodles, spicy fried chicken, fuqi feypian (spicy tendons and slice beef), and kong xin cai (Chinese water spinach) are my favorite dishes to eat here.  The service is fast and friendly...and the prices are cheap!!!\n\nWe will definitely be back...","570":"Maybe loving spicy food is why I rate all the Sichuan places so high but I'll be damned if Mala isn't one of the best restaurants in town.  \n\nNevermind the food. It is undoubtly spectacular.  I'll skip that part.  I'll say it again: if you're wondering how the food is, it is faaantastic.\n\nWhat I'm surprised at is how clean this restaurant is and the service.  The second you walk in, everything looks spotless.  We went during rush hour and, while they had a few tables in front of us, everyone was seated in a timely fashion.  There was only 3 of us in our party and yet were allowed to sit in a table more fitting for 6.  The servers were surprisingly nice, attentive and constantly checked on our table.  If you know service in Chinatown, then you know this is the equivalent of finding Big Foot riding a unicorn trying to chase down a centaur on route 99.  \n\nI will be back here every time I'm in town.\n\nOh and one food bit: get the spicy crispy chicken. You're welcome.","571":"Heard many good things about this place. But I didn't find anything special. The dishes are more or less Americanized \"authentic Chinese food\". If you speak Chinese and look for real authentic Chinese food, this may not be the best place. However if you don't speak Chinese, this can be a good place as their staff apparently speak good English, which is not always the case in Chinatown.","572":"Definitely have some Ma-la action here.  This theme runs strong with most of their signature dishes pretty heavy in that.  Just wish this place offered a hot pot!  If you are a fan of their spicy food i would get their fried chicken, lamb, dan dan noodles.  all pretty solid.  For the newbs out their Ma = numb, La = spicy, a unique flavor to sichuan peeps.  Takes a lil getting used to at first, but you'll easily get addicted.","573":"i really enjoyed the food here, plus i love spicy food. there was a wait but i highly recommend it.\n\nwe ordered the dan dan noodles, red chili oil dumplings, garlic bacon appetizer, water boiled fish, cumin beef, spicy garlic eggplant, mapo tofu, spicy crispy chicken, and wonton soup. i enjoyed all the dishes.  my favorites were probably the spicy garlic eggplant, chili oil dumplings, and water boiled fish. the cumin in the cumin beef was very strong but i liked it, the others did not. \n\nwe had 7 girls and the bill was around $120, paid cash so we got 5% off.  my only complaint is that they never came by to refill our waters, much needed for spicy food, and it was SO hot in the restaurant.  we mentioned it but i don't think they did anything about it.","574":"Ordered the red oil Winton's and they were amazing!!!  Also the spicy crispy chicken which was good bit basically tiny pieces of fried chicken.  But as long as you got a piece of chicken with the herbs and peppers all in one bite then that hit the spot.. Also had an order of mongolian beef.  It had good flavor but that meat has a strange texture..overall food was good","575":"Where to start? This place is delicious and if you love tasting authentic sichuan food, this place is the way to go. \n\nI've been here many times and everything I've had here was delicious. Here is what I've ordered so far.\n\nDan dan noodles - must get (easily a favorite for everyone)\nHouse cold sesame noodles - it's good but brace yourself for cold noodles (I know that sounds stupid but still)\nChengdu Mungbean jelly- my wife's favorite\nChengdu style prawns - awesomeness if you like prawns\nSpicy and crispy chicken - a plate full of peppers and fried chicken bits...cmon now\nCouples liver slices - NOT FOR EVERYONE...but a good dish if you want authenticity\nSauteed water spinach - order it with garlic and spices = delicious\n\nI've also heard the bacon wrapped cucumber was good too!\n\nAlso as everyone says...make it rain! because you get a 5% discount if you pay with cash.","576":"Food would be a lot better... if things were a little LESS spicy and salty.\nI'm 100% asian when it comes to spicy food. I love spicy food.\nHowever, the food at this place was so spicy that I couldn't taste and savor the food.\n\nMy tongue was just hot and numb to taste anything.","577":"Their staff is very polite and friendly! Food taste is average.\nThe reason that I gave 2 stars is  the  dish served time and served without  particular order.\nAfter I ordered the appetizer and entree, 5 minutes later, my entree came. After 3 minutes, all my dishes I ordered came together!  Too fast! of course that showed the food is absolutely not fresh!\nBut their Dan Dan noodle is good!","578":"dan dan noodles little spicy is on point! My favorite dish was the water boil fish! id come back and try the other food also","579":"Really good spicy food that gets fairly busy during the weekends. If you like spice and numbing sauces then this is the place for you.\n\nThe shrimp chili dish, sweet and sour cabbage, and chicken chili dish are all really good.\n\nTry coming here during the weekday for lunch, it is a lot less busy and service will be slightly better.","580":"went there for lunch on a tuesday around noon. \n\nOrdered their lunch specials of Konjac Duck ($6.95), Cumin Beef ($6.95) and Spicy Eggplant ($4.95).  Their Lunch special comes with soup and 2 sides ( boiled cabbage and julienned potatoes). \n\nMeh for reals, you're in trouble when one of the better dishes of the day was the napa cabbage and spam soup that came with the lunch special. The konjac duck dish came in a small bowl half filled with konjac and the rest was mostly duck necks and two pieces of thigh. The flavor was forgettable.\n\nThe cumin beef, came with flabby beef that had seen too much meat tenderizer, it was mushy and just tasted greasy. Their spicy eggplant was decent, had a nice sauce that was relatively authentic tasting, this was the best dish of the day. The serving portions are decent (minus the konjac duck, that was a total ripoff).\n\n they give you a 5% discount if you pay in cash.\n\nso yeah anyway the verdict is .... MEH! It is doubtful I will comeback,  I guess I dont have much to say about this restaurant except be wary of their lunch specials.","581":"I have visited this place about 5 times and so far everything is good. I must warn those who can't handle hot peppers well, because hot dishes are pretty spicy. Well that's expected of Sichuan (Szechuan) food. The ingredients are always fresh, we (my family) love Egg Plant in Garlic Sauce (not too spicy). \nFish (flounder) and Tofu in Mala sauce (hot) is awesome. It has the distinctive Szechuan Pepper Corn. \nWe just had Triple Pepper beaten Duck and it has, Szechuan Pepper Corns, Chilli Peppers and Serano Peppers.\nAnother new thing we tried is Combination Fried Rice with shrimp, beef and chicken. It is not spicy and is very good.","582":"An old friend came into town craving authentic Sichuan food. After reading the reviews for Mala we went there on Monday Feb. 2. The restaurant is cozy and attractive with linen tablecloths. The service was prompt and attentive. The food was delicious. We had the green oil shrimp, beef Kovacs, Malaysian beef jerky, crispy chicken and red rabbit (we are big guys with big appetites.) Every dish was fresh, flavorful and authentic. We had a great dinner and great time.\n     Now the bad. When we walked out into the parking lot we found our vehicle, along with a few others, had our windows smashed and our belongings taken. It was freezing outside so waiting for the police was no fun. The cop mentioned this happens often here. So in spite of the great food, atmosphere and service the night was completely ruined by the thieves. This is a busy strip center with many businesses. I don't understand why more action is not taken to stop this menace. This made a 4 star review turn to two stars as I can't really recommend this restaurant after my experience.","583":"The food was AMAZING yet a little spicy for kiddos. Highly recommend Tea smoked duck and crispy leek & Basil intestines. We had the tiramisu Mille crepe cake it was delicious but the $9 was a tad pricey for a piece of cake. The Red oil Wonton was delicious but a tad spicy for the kids. The atmosphere was nice. The staff are very  friendly but hard to understand as their English are weak. Will definitely come back .","584":"De-li-ci-ous!! That's honestly all I can say.\n\nThey have a pretty standard fare when it comes to authentic Sichuan cuisine, but you can tell that their food is amazing just by the sheer amount of people packed inside the restaurant.\n\nI'm sure everyone probably has their own favorite dish, but I especially liked the water boiled fish and three pepper beaten duck. The fish was extremely tender and flavorful, and packs a punch to boot. The duck was smoked perfectly, though there was a bit too much bone to pick out.\n\nOverall, this is one of the better Sichuan places I've been to, both in terms of taste and price.","585":"Fresh made noodles are dense but thin, perfect earthy flavor. Spicy Eggplant was very oily, but that is the style, and the fresh herbs In it were perfect. The shrimp is de-veined but still has shells on, didn't mind because they are quality. All of the ingredients were high quality and thoughtfully prepared.","586":"This was a great serendipitous find and the food did not disappoint. I had the water boiled beef, but don't go by the name alone. It's a good spicy preparation but a little on the greasy side. But then that's expected with Sichuan food.\n\nWe also ordered the usual slew of things, from mapo tofu, shrimp and tofu and a spicy shrimp preparation. And some spinach with garlic. Food quality was consistently good and reasonably priced. Though the lunch time service was a tad slow.\n\nWill definitely go back and enjoy the wares more often","587":"If spicy is good, does more spicy mean? \n\nMala is a sesame oil based mix with grinded red peppers to permeate heat in to the foods while preserving it. Most Sichuan style restaurants will offer items with this type of seasoning.\n\nWell this is the place to test that Heat+ theory from what I've been told.  We get in, service was good, and got to the table and was informed of the house specials, and off we went.\n\nFood:\n\nMala soup beef: beef was tender, but the sauce is just off. It's like soaking good cuts of beef in the deep frier of old oil at KFC, and not much other seasoning. C\n\ncooked veggies: Decent, fresh and tedner, but a bit salty. B\n\nOil cooked fish: This is the house specialty, the talapia is fresh, and the sauce is very nice. A\n\nOver all I think there are better places for this style of food. Although it does intrigue me to see a very mixed nationalities enjoying the restaurant at my time of visit.","588":"I'm frequently in Chinatown and Mala Sichuan has become one of my go-to places. \n\nThe Dan Dan Noodles are the best in town, by far. For first-timers, be sure to mix the noodles because all the sauce is at the bottom. If you don't mix it, then it becomes bland. This sounds very basic, but trust me, if you're a first-timer, I just read a review that said the Dan Dan Noodles here are bland and there's no way that's the case - unless the noodles weren't mixed with the sauce underneath.\n\nThe Hot and Sour Soup - pretty much any place has hot and sour, right? This place does it right. PLUS the hot sauce, given upon request, is pretty killer too, as in tasty. I happen to think this soup mixes extremely well with the hot sauce and black vinegar I usally apply to all my hot and sour soups.\n\nSo those are my two go-to orders at Mala Sichuan, but I've had enough on the menu to know their selection of good dishes is there. There's a lot of good options. I just kinda know those dishes by their Chinese names and not their English ones.\n\nThe one downside to Mala Sichuan: it is becoming too well-known after being one of the rare Chinatown spots on the mainsteam foodie map. Therefore, the place is flooded by Chinatown regulars and also the Chinatown not-so-regulars who know nowhere else to go. This means that on weekends, expect there to be a wait for tables for probably both lunch and dinner.\n\nThen again, that's not going to make me give up going to the place with the best Dan Dan Noodles in town.","589":"This is awesome place to eat in Chinatown. The food is tasty and the service is decent. \n\nI have tried the spicy crispy chicken with the Sichuan peppercorns and red chillies which is really good. The chicken is fried though. \n\nThe chinese eggplant in the sweet and savory sauce is also delectable\n\n4 on 5 for the chili oil dumplings And the Dan Dan noodles. They're just standard. \n\nThe tilapia in the hot oil is also really well done.\n\nMala sichuan's food is actually comparable to some of the sichuan food i had in china on my recent trip.\n\npay with cash and get a 5% discount off the total tab!","590":"Excellent: The service was excellent, food was served very fast;\nQuality of food is Better than Average:\nAverage: Price; - all the appetizer dishes are $4.95, which is higher than some other places at China town. We ordered Bamboo shoots as appetizer, the quality is so so; I liked the Cumin beef, good quality, beef was tender and not mushy, price was $13.95; Hot Sour soup, good value, but color was too dark, too much soy sauce, I guess. Spicy noodle was good. It cost two of us $46 for a dinner (including $6 tips) , the value is not that great compare to so many other nice restaurants in Chinatown.","591":"My favorite dish is the broiled fish and red oil dumplings. Everything was delicious. Garlic eggplant  and Mongolian beef! Dan dan noodles were a 4\/5 but still good.","592":"One of the better Sichuan restaurants in the greater Houston area.\n\nFood: 3.7\nService: 4\/5\nAmbiance: 3\/5\nOverall: 3.6\n\nAppetizers: (I don't remember the translations, so I'll try my best to translate from Chinese)\n\nDan Dan noodles - 4\/5. Executed well, but nothing special.\n\nGarlic puree with pork slices - 3\/5. An overall unique take, but too sweet and not spicy enough. My reference is 888's version of this.\n\nSpicy beef slices - 2\/5 - beef too tough, spicy herb flavor doesn't work for this dish.\n\nEntrees:\n\nPhoenix flavor chili chicken - **5\/5 - the best I've ever had, in America OR in China. This classic Szechuan dish is executed perfectly here with the perfect balance of spiciness, garlic, and chicken. Mouth watering indeed.\n\nWater boiled fish - 4\/5 - quite good, though a tossup between this one and 888's version. Excellent with rice. Spicy enough.\n\nMouth watering beef - 3\/5. Parents liked this dish, but the beef was ordinary. Sauce similar to the water boiled fish.\n\nString beans with bamboo - *4\/5. The \"meat sauce\" that goes with the beans is superb. Proper amount of \"wok hei\" in this demanding dish. Bamboo tender.\n\nFood gets a 4\/5 for the great entrees, spoiled by the very mediocre apps.\n\nService is ordinary, in that while they are reasonably polite, they randomly forget certain orders and such. Service speed can be quite slow during busy nights.\n\nAmbiance: Fairly ordinary, but decent for a Chinese restaurant. Waiting area uncomfortable. Otherwise, fairly clean.\n\nScoring guidelines:\n\nOverall score is average of food  (50%), service (30%), and ambiance (20%).\nRounding is subjective based on impression of restaurant.\nTotal food score is average of apps, entrees, and desserts.

This time I only ordered a \u8fa3\u5b50\u9e21 and \u5e72\u7178\u725b\u8089\u4e1d (spicy crispy chicken and dried beef strips) with an emphasis to add more spiciness and numbness. And they definitely delivered it this time! I can't even remember the last time I sweated and had to blow my nose from the spiciness. So as a tip, the taste is definitely better if you're not competing against a full restaurant of customers for food! I'm not sure how the lunch crowd is, but going in the afternoon is def a safer bet than for dinner. The food tastes good even after cooling","594":"Hands down the best Sichuan Food in town! Order: spicy & crispy chicken, boiled fish, boiled beef, spicy eggplant garlic sauce, yang chow fried rice, and chengdu prawn","595":"Wow first experience in Houston's Chinatown and I am thoroughly impressed. Delicious spicy dumplings.  Amazing crispy chicken and hot peppers. A huge portion of rice.  Perfect for sharing. So much more on the menu to try.  No orange chicken sadly. Nice and helpful staff.  Quick service. Ethnic but delicious and not too weird. Not your American chinese for sure.","596":"Great quality food and service. my favorite is Dan dan noodle. It's soooo  delicious,\nPrices are very reasonable as well. I will definitely go back.","597":"Came here to eat for the first time. We ate Cumin beef,  mala beef jerky, shredded pork with spicy garlic sauce and wanton soup and it was delicious. I loved the spices and flavor. The service is fast as well.  Will definitely come back here.","598":"If you speak Spanish, don't let the name fool you!\n\nMala as it turns out is the spicy oily sauce that's on many of their dishes... and we had a couple...\n\nQuick note... bring cash so you can get 5% discount.\n\nIf you're not that familiar with the Bellaire area you can miss this hidden gem. Huh... I never thought I would consider a Chinese restaurant to be a hidden gem.  For most, that might be an overstatement, but since I don't frequent this part of town, it feels like the right thing to say.  After what I'm getting ready to say and describe, our 12-14 mile round trip drive may end up being a monthly thing, if not more...\n\nMy wife is gonna love me a little more, since Chinese food is one of her favorites!\n\nFor starters we were a party of 4, drank no alcohol, ordered 1 appetizer and 4 entrees (no leftovers) and with the 5% cash discount our bill with a generous tip was $60.\n\nWe arrived at the restaurant around 630p and we had our choice of seating, since we were the only ones there.  For a Thursday night it didn't last long before the crowd started coming in.  It was nicely decorated, the tables, chairs and table coverings were clean and thankfully not sticky.\n\nThe service was good... drink orders were taken quickly, they gave us time to look over the menu and they remained attentive to our emptying glasses of water and our quickly diminishing bowls of rice :)\n\nLet the feasting begin...\n\nHere is our order... red oil dumplings, four joy lion head, black pepper beef, water boiled fish fillet and kung pao chicken.  Each of these dishes had their own unique mouthwatering flavors, even if they were hot and spicy!!\n\nThe red oil dumpling was just that... good size steamed beef or pork dumplings nicely soaked in red oil.  Even though the red oil is spicy it didn't take away the flavors from the beef or pork.\n\nAll 4 of the entrees came out one right after the other.\n\nThe first was the black pepper beef.  For some reason I'm not a big fan of black pepper beef, but after tasting this version, it may be hard for me to like any other version.  The sauce, beef, rice and vegetable combination was out of this world.  If you're watching your rice intake, be warned that it will be very difficult... but I think eating this dish without rice is that good...\n\nThe next dish was four joy lion head.  They can name these large meatballs whatever they like.  They were surprisingly moist and once again another flavorful dish.  This was the mildest dish we ordered...\n\nThe next dish I tried was the water boiled fish fillet.  This was definitely the spiciest dish we ordered.  The fish was soaked in a bowl of red oil.  Surprisingly, I could actually taste the goodness of the fish.  The red oil definitely made the dish spicy... before I could get through the first serving, I was dripping in sweat... I could feel the beads of sweat forming on the top of my head and slowly working their way down my face...\n\nBut here's the good thing about this type of spice... it does not linger.  It burns for a few minutes and goes away AND it doesn't cause your lips to turn red like spices on crawfish.\n\nThe last dish was the kung pao chicken.  Here's another dish I haven't been too crazy about after trying it from other places.  But this recipe had a good kick and for some reason got me hooked.  I may sound like a broken record but how much flavor can they put in their dishes!\n\nThe prices of their family style serving was very reasonable and definitely worth a repeat visit.... whether it's to dine-in or take-out, we'll definitely be back!!","599":"As a Taiwanese-American (on my father's side), I'm admittedly a Sichuan novice when it comes to food. Oh sure, I snuck the occasional signature hot oil and peppercorn concoction into some of my orders, my personal favorite being the spicy Niu Rou Mien (beef noodle soup) at Chinese Cafe. But on the whole, I've been pretty much oblivious to this spicy subculture of Chinese food.\n\nBut when the Chronicle's Alison Cook wrote a glowing review for Mala Sichuan, describing the spiciness in vivid, delicious detail, and consequently setting my mouth on drool-mode, I knew I had to check it out. (The review: http:\/\/www.29-95.com\/restaurants\/story\/restaurant-review-mala-sichuan-bistro-offers-emphatic-and-complex-flavors)\n\nMy dad and I checked out Mala Sichuan on a Sunday evening, and even then the place was packed. It appeared that I wasn't the only one intrigued by Cook's review. At least three tables were occupied by non-Asian folk, which still comes as a rarity around them parts. It was either the review, the word \"bistro\" in the moniker, or the BYOB policy that only they seemed to know about.\n\nWhat was my point again? Oh yes, the place was packed, and for good reason. The food is good.\n\nWe picked up a trio of dishes, and lo and behold, they all came doused in the signature peppercorn red spiciness. Let's get this out of the way now. If you're not a fan of your mouth burning, Sichuan food probably isn't for you. Oh sure, there are a multitude of non-spicy dishes--my dad was eying the green beans, a Taiwanese favorite--but if you're looking for mild, you might as well go elsewhere.\n\nThe House Special Cold Noodles, Cook's favorite, were nothing short of spectacular. It tastes like a fusion of everything great about Sichuan food--the peppercorn, the red chili peppers, the hot oil, the peanut and\/or sesame sweetness, and the garlic\/ginger\/scallion complement. It's a wonderfully tasting, ridiculously simple dish that tastes even better as leftovers, either hot or cold.\n\nThe Funky Stick Chicken, so named (I think) because the chicken may be meat or tendon, is just a redux of the Noodles. If you like to be surprised by your bite--it could be crunchy!--this dish might be for you. I'd rather had the delectable consistency of the house-made noodles. Then again, as an Asian who loves Italian, I'm a sucker for all things in pasta\/noodle form.\n\nFor our main dish, we shared the Chengdu-style Prawns, also a Cook recommendation. If I wasn't already sold on Alison Cook (and if you read some of my other Yelp reviews, you know I am), I was after reading her Mala Sichuan review. She was spot on about how spectacular Mala Sichuan is, and the gigantic prawns, freshly cut vegetables, and delicious peppercorn-based sauce is making my mouth drool.\n\nBy the way, there's a 5% discount if you pay cash.\n\nI'd been sitting on this review, hoping to make a return visit in order to give it a more proper write-up. But after writing it, my mouth is literally salivating as I think about these plates, and I can't wait to go back. That's what a 5* place should be.","600":"This has to be one of the best Sichuan restaurants in Houston.  Set in the China Town section of Bellaire Blvd, it's small and a little hard to find, but worth the trouble.  Get there early because it fills up early.  Many of the dishes are spicy and, my favorite, the Water Boiled Fish will leave your mouth wonderfully hot. Be sure to share whatever you order with others at your table so everyone can enjoy.","601":"Sichuan in Houston? this is it!!! NYTimes themselves pointed this as a hot spot for legitimate food.   The shanghai style noodles with peanutbutter\/vingear sauce comes close to my moms...insane.  The dan dan noodles are the best I've ever had. I have yet to venture to Sichuan but I'm guessing this is as good as there.","602":"Spicy is the operative word here. My friend and I stopped here for a working lunch. I had the crispy fried chicken and Dan Dan noodles. She had the salt and pepper prawns and Dan Dan noodles without pork. Without question, the noodles stole the show. They were hearty and flavorful. Brought back some remnants on my shirt, but it was worth the dry cleaning bill. \n\nThe crispy and spicy chicken was wicked. It was a one-to-one ratio of fried chicken to dried red peppers. That is then spiced with sliced garlic and spices. It lit me up and yet, I couldn't get enough of it.\n\nService was attentive and professional. I can't wait to return.","603":"I love this place. Cold noodles sound weird but they are fantastic. A pork dish with leeks sliced so thin, so tender and moist still. And no one walks away hungry.","604":"Amazing Chinese\/Sichuanese food! The place is a bit far from the downtown\/midtown area, but definitely it is worth to drive and try it. We got the Eggplants and the Chicken and, fyi, we did not talk at all during the dinner: we couldn't stop eating! :D We also got a couple of TsingTaos; the total cost was $25 (notice that we needed a box for leftovers). Super friendly staff, excellent food, cheap prices... what else? Cannot wait to come back!!!!","605":"Great food.  But you have to like Sichuan food....it is spicy and it just builds in a nice way until your mouth is numb.  The Dan Dan noodles are the bomb as is the Spicy Crispy Chicken.  Parking is a bit of a pain so try to go on off hours.  The place was packed but the wait was only about 10 minutes.  Services was great and the best I've had in a Chinese restaurant in Houston.","606":"Had lunch here today.  Dan noodles and wonton soup.  Really good stuff.  I'd definitely go back","607":"I used to like the place and go there every weekend, but recently the food is not as good as b4. I've already found an alternative place which tastes better and charge a little less. So I won't go there any more.","608":"I love love love this place. Fav place in Chinatown by far. Fan of their hot and sour soup and crispy chicken. Dan dan noodles are top notch. Fairly priced and family owned. Gets super busy on weekends but it's worth the wait.","609":"It's been few months from my last visit.  The taste of food is still good and service is quiet improved.  The service we received from last three visits were not so pleasant.  New discovery:  fish soup is worth to try.","610":"When I lived in Milwaukee there was a small Chinese restaurant in the area that served a dish called Lion's Head. It was pork meatballs served over lettuce which made it look like the lion's mane. It was one of my favorites, and I hadn't see this dish anywhere else. Once I read Mala Sichuan had it on their menu, we just had to go.\n\nSo Mala Sichuan made it to the top 10 list of restaurants in the Houston Press while being a relatively new place. This would probably account for how full the place was on Friday night. We didn't have to wait too long but our group of six was placed in a really small table...a little too cozy but no big deal. The servers and staff were really nice although some of them really didn't speak English. The vibe was more modern than the other restaurants in the area\n\nMala Sichuan is less homey than some of the other Sichuan restaurants in the area, but the food was fantastic. We ordered the Lion's head, of course, the Mala sichuan beef, the crispy chicken, water boiled fish, and steamed ribs with crushed rice. The Lion's head had 4 huge pork meatballs with a ginger brown sauce, served over bok choy. They were so tender you could cut them with a fork. The crispy chicken basically was chicken nuggets stir fried with chili peppers. The other favorite was the water boiled fish (spicy) , although this one was pretty much standard. The ribs were good although the flavor was one-note. \n\nI love Sichuan food and this place has some of the best in the area.","611":"These cats do not play around. This is honest - to - goodness - too-many - peppers - to- count Szechuan cooking. Do not come here unless that is truly what you want. If it IS what you want, come quickly!  The red oil dumplings are awesome. You will need help to get through the menu, so bring friends --easy to read, but so many choices.","612":"There is so much hype about this place, it's like \"you don't know what you are missing\" if you don't try it once.  Once is enough for me, I am from Sichuan and I was looking for hometown flavor in particular.  First let me say, it is a wonder place to dine.  Service is good and food is decent.  I was looking for the Sichuan flavor and I must say to me the restaurant cross the street is closer to what I was looking for, the Sichuan house.  It is not a Sichuan dish If there are no Sichuan pepper corn in a hot spicy dish.","613":"Waited a long time and drove across town for this experience and guess what. ....i would do all over again and again and again. AMAZING.","614":"Probably one of the best places in Chinatown. Definitely worth the journey and would return.","615":"wow! \n\non tuesday i came here on a whim after my mouth was craving something spicy, and yelp led me here. i came on a tuesday around 1pm, so if there was a lunch crowd, i would not know much of it. the restaurant is located a corner behind don's cafe. \n\nthe waitress was very friendly (she was young, but didnt speak english very well, still tried hard to help me order! e-props to her.)\n\ni ordered the dan dan noodles like the other reviews said, and boy, it was spicy. now im not much of a pansy when it comes to spicy food, but the broth underneath the noodles did make my lips feel as if they were on fire. the noodles were delicious and had the perfect texture. the beef crumbles and spinach on top was awesome! it tasted like deliciousness burning a fire hot red on my mouth.\n\ni also had the hot & sour soup. the soup here, for $4.95 was an entire BOWL. not a small little thing. A BOWL THE SIZE OF MY FACE. now im not sure if its possible to mess up on hot and sour soup, but this place made me feel like all the other places ive ever had the soup has been doing it wrong! the flavors were on point and delicious! it was awesome. i spooned some out onto a small bowl for myself and eventually had the rest to-goed. (i love hot and sour soup. hehehe.)\n\nfrom their lunch special menu (prices on the lunch menu ranged from 3.95-6.95, from what i remember) and so the pricing was pretty decent. \nwow. the best. i had the eggplant in chili garlic sauce with rice and it was HEAVEN! i love me some eggplant and this place does it right! even my dad (a former chinese chef) had to admit that it was good! AHH! yums! my mother loved it! and you know, even though im an elite, my mom's rating is what really counts to me. \n\nthe waitress and waiter was attentive to my needs and refilled my water accordingly. as soon as i looked at him, he came over and asked if i needed togo boxes. done and done. \n\ni will definitely return here for lunch often, just gotta remember to bring my nexium because boy, they know how to turn up the heat! D:\n\n-p.s. i am honored to have this place and my #50 review on yelp! :)","616":"This place needs a bigger floor space. Business is a BOOMING. Lines are a waiting. But seriously the food speaks for itself. I had the tilapia, and bacon cucumber rolls. HNNNGGGG the food is so flavorful and spicy. I loved it. Best place in China Town so far. Someone please send me a note if you've had better.","617":"As is usual when I'm visiting a city that has a reasonable number of chinese people, I Yelped for the best chinese restaurants in the area.  Mala came up on my searches fairly often.  Is it worth the hype?  Yes, I'd say so.  Ordered my standard for Szechuan restaurants - the \"Water boiled fish filet\".  It was quite authentic.  Very good.  Warning to those who might not have had Szechuan food:  this dish is 1) very spicy, as expected, and  2) very oily.  The oil actual keeps the spice and flavor well - so, it's a necessary ingredient.  We also ordered the \"Dry Fried Double Veggies\", which is basically stir-fried string beans with diced pork and bamboo shoots.  Excellent dish.   \n\nDan Dan noodles are a must-try based on prior reviews, and I concur.  The key is the noodles.  I'm not sure if they make the noodles on site or order them from another vendor, but they taste handmade.\n\nLastly, I'm a sucker for Hot and Sour Soup.  I know - this tends to be offered for more Americanized chinese restaurants, but when it's done well, I still love it.  Well, it was done well here.  $5 and you get a HUGE bowl.\n\nService is surprisingly good for a chinese restaurant.  They checked our tea and rice levels frequently.  And the decor is fitting and not at all overly dirty.  \n\nPrice - typical though some items seemed unnecessarily high (i.e., upper teens to low 20s in price for the \"specials\").  The portions are large though.  So, it could be argued that this makes for the price.\n\nWhy not 5-stars?  Because I've had better Szechuan food, and this isn't \"as good as it gets\".  It is definitely a nice find though.  Would go back if I happen to be in Houston again.","618":"Loved it. \nEverything is good, from the handmade chinese wonton, to the chengdu clear noodles ( my childhood favourite, I was unable to find it in the other sichuan restaurant ) or the cumin beef ( usually when the cumin beef is good- the restaurant is as well ) . \nI also love the spicy beef tendon and the steamed ribs with rice - I don t know how to say it in english and it s Weekend only : it s a kind of kurobuta sichuan style : with very tender steamed pork and spices )\n\nThey use very fresh ingredients and change the menu regularly.\n\nThey even give you 5% off when you pay cash. The waitress speaks very good english.\n\nMy family is from Sichuan and I know when a Sichuan restaurant is good nor the dishes authentic. This one is by far the best I ve tried in the USA, not only in Houston.","619":"Things to remember: \n1. Bring cash, you get a 5% discount\n2. Popular place, so bigger groups will take a long time to get seated (groups of 2 were invited in quickly)\n3. A variety of meats for everyone to choose from, fear not of the red pepper laden foods, white rice saves the day (i.e. fried chicken and red chiles, super addicting!!)\n4. Salt and pepper prawns, delicious when hot and crispy but beware for the salty sensitive\n5. Bacon\/cucumber\/garlic \"roll ups\", a good starter\n6. Dan dan noodles, the table's favorite\n\nThis restaurant is probably 4 stars in the eyes of my fellow  table mates, but the dishes I ordered was a little too overseasoned for my taste. Think 5 spice powder. There is definitely lots to choose from though, a welcome addition to restaurant row.","620":"If you like spicy Sichuan food, this place is great. It was my first time having lunch there with friends. The waitress was courteous and efficient. We had six dishes and they were all tasty and spicy. I think I hadn't had better Sichuan food when I lived in New York. Will definitely go back.","621":"It seemed really \"authentic\" since I didn't recognize many items on the menu. When I travel I know it may be some time before I return, so I tend to order a little more than I can eat - like an extra starter - so that I can sample a bit. \n\nTonight I decided to pick at least a couple of totally unfamiliar items -livin' on the edge. Anyway, it was a cold beef tendon? marinated in spices (4 peppers) and dumplings in red oil. The beef was served cold and the dumplings hot.  I know, the names are a little weird, but they were both very good - different, but good.\n\nI stuck with the kung poa chicken as a familiar \"standby.\" It was also very good.\n\nLarge portions, prompt service, and great value. If I lived in the area, I'd do takeout all the time.","622":"I went with a friend for lunch here. Tried ordering something from the seafood menu but was told they didn't have the cutter fish and the server recommended the Water Boiled Fish saying it was customers' favorite. I kept asking about what comes with the dish but she kept saying try it. The Water Boiled Fish dish came super-fast before my friend's Eggplant dish. I tried my food and it was soo...... fishy and slimy with a lot of oil. I couldn't eat it and I called up the waiter to complain. She was like well I can't change it once you order you pay. So I ordered for another dish Crispy Chicken to be on the safe side since no one can spoil a chicken dish hopefully. \nI told her to get me a takeout box. She never came back, had to get her when she was serving the table beside us. Told her please get me a manager she said I'm the manager (lied). So I told her you know what cancel the fish order i m not paying for it and give me the chicken order. The waiter was like (with a loud rude voice) i am going to cancel this one but next time you can never cancel anything again. i was like does that mean i should never come back here again? She was like no but next time we won't do it. So I said ok. \nOne minute later she was back with the same loud voice saying i tried your Water Boiled Fish and there was nothing wrong with it and no other customer complained saying \"just to let you know\".\nI told her I wasn't disputing her facts but I can't do too fishy nor slimy because this will make me throw up and also she forced me to pick the dish. But she kept going on and on causing all other customers to look at us weirdly. My friend was likewise pissed and had to tell her to lower her voice.\nThen came another waiter with the bill (we asked for 2 bills) but came with one bill and gave it to my friend. i told my friend he thinks you will be the one paying because I'm \"BLACK\" not knowing i was paying.\nWhen we left my friend was like that was an experience.  Won't ever go back again.\nStill threw up when I got home......","623":"Food is EXTREMELY salty here.  It is not overly spicy, as some have claimed, but almost every dish my table of 5 had was extremely overly salted (MSG? Not sure).\n\nAlso, the oil rubbed rabbit had good flavor, but it STILL HAD THE BONES IN IT!  It was chopped up into tiny pieces, and many of the bones were extremely tiny, so it was literally impossible to de-bone as served.  My entire table just stopped eating it after a couple bites.\n\nI will say that service is fast, and they do serve beer, unlike a lot of the other Chinatown places.","624":"The food is terrific.\nAt the Westheimer location management needs to make some changes.\n   The chairs in the beautiful garden are adirondak type chairs with 130 degree backs,\nmaking it nearly impossible to eat at the table....replace them or furnish back cushions\n   We were not given water upstairs. We ordered rose wine and were told they only had one glass. We ordered 3 starters and some t0fu and  3 mains. We finished the first course and waited 25 minutes, asked about the 3 main courses and were told they had forgotten to give them to the kitchen. We cancelled one because it would have taken 25 minutes. The food was fine. \n   The menu came in a leather case,perhaps to justify the high prices\/location, but the \nsad thing was that the printing was so bad it couldn't be read, and the vegetables page was almost blank. We ordered water spinach...and were told they didn't have any..\n    We were told to come early to eat at 7pm because it fills up at that time and they don't take reservations. It was empty. We would have enjoyed more  coming at 7pm.\n   Houston needs many more chinese restaurants, especially ones specializing in cooking regional recipes. This location will fail unless management pays  attention to the service elements. Get a good readable cheap menu, reduce the prices a little bit and make sure the menu items are available and the staff is trained. \n    Send the staff off to the CIA or Hilton for a weekend of training.","625":"Mala Sichuan rests where Xiong Di (Brothers in English) use to be and seems to be doing much better than its predecessor.  The only word needed to describe this place is spicy (it is sichuan after all).\n\nWe got:\nDan dan noodles - spicy, but definitely mild compared to some of the other dishes, the noodles were cooked perfectly and tender.  The dish was flavorful without the spiciness overwhelming the dish.\n\nSour and spicy intestine noodles - SPICY.  I thought I was going to turn into a fire breathing dragon.  The broth was spicy on its own and they added more pepper on top that you could mix in if you chose to do so (stop and think before you mix excitedly).\n\nShui zhu yu (water cooked fish) - spicy spicy broth also with more pepper on top.  It was a bit more manageable than the sour and spicy intestine noodles but still made me sweat.  I was surprised at the amount of fish they gave us and there was also some cabbage hiding at the bottom.\n\nChicken with serrano peppers - Don't be deceived by the name of the dish, this was the least spicy of the dishes.  Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of peppers cooked with the dish, but they just seem to be around the chicken.  The chicken was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  Flavorful and delicious, it was probably my favorite of the night.\n\nWill be back.","626":"Sichuan with a Taiwanese twist.  In summary:  best Sichuan in town, best Taiwanese in town, pay cash for a 5% discount, good service, great for parties large and small.  See my breakdown below.  I save the best for last...the food!\n\nSeatage: typical Chinese restaurant complete with a private room for larger dinner parties.\n\nService:  great service and nice wait staff and owners.  Very attentive and accommodating.\n\nFood:  we have tried at least 70% of the menu and is pretty bulls eye in terms of Taiwanese authenticity.   4 stars for the food since random dishes are more salty than they should be at random times.\n\n1. Cucumber:  one of my favorite appetizers.   Fresh, crisp, and perfectly seasoned.  Feels like my mom just clipped the cucumbers from her summer garden...  Which is what she used to do growing up.\n\n2. All the vegetable dishes are really good.  Taiwanese style.. Not spicy.\n\n3.pigs blood and intestine stew:  not for the faint of heart..one of my favorite.\n\n4. Dark vinegar clear noodles:  String vinegar broth with chewy noodles.   Not my favorite dish but it was interesting to try.\n\n\nReview to be continued after I get back in town  (in boston now) and don a menu by my side to make recommendations from the line items.  \n\n\nTootles for now!","627":"I am an avid Yelper so when I read Daniel H's review I told my wife we had to have Sunday lunch there. We are practically vegetarian, she being the born and raised \"not even eggs\" vegetarian, whereas I have eaten everything there is. Now it's fish and not much else. We were seated promptly, given menus and asked about drinks. Water with ice and we perused the menus for our vegetarian options.\n\nMy wife asked if they could make the hot and sour soup without eggs, fermented tofu and mushrooms. Our waiter checked with the chef and said they could. We ordered the soup, mapo tofu and spinach with hot pepper sauce. Our attentive waiter brought two soup bowls and spoons along with a large ceramic container of steamed white rice. This was followed by a LARGE bowl of steaming soup and the spinach. We could see the little pieces of red peppers peeking from the lush green spinach.\n\nLast but not the least came the mapo tofu which together with the soup made our day. Next time we will just have soup here, tofu banh mis at Don's Sandwich Shop and top it off with shaved ice with some yummy toppings at May's Ice Cream :-,) The spinach wasn't that appealing. But I brought home generous portions of the left over tofu and rice.\n\nWe also took up their offer of a 5% cash discount on the bill. English speaking wait staff, accommodating special requests, not a run of the mill menu, good basic decor and overall \"we will be back for more\" sentiment earns this place 5 stars.","628":"3.5 stars\n\nNot nearly as spicy as more traditional Sichuan restaurants but a great meal all the same! All the dishes were well flavored and fresh- service was even a notch above most typical chinese restaurants. \n\n\nWill definitely be back when craving a little spice in Houston!","629":"Best MaPo Tofu I've ever had.  Hands down, and that's the dish I use to measure the quality if a Chinese restaurant.\n\nUPDATE:  My friends and I went back.  Had the surf clams with onion and sichuan sauce.  Amazing.  My friend also went \"beast mode\" on a bowl on Dan Dan Noodles, which were also incredible.  The consensus at the table that night was that this new restaurant is THE best Szechuan, if not the best Chinese, in Houston.\n\nANOTHER UPDATE: Do yourself a favor and (on top of the arctic clams) also try the Cumin Beef (or Lamb) and the Chendu Prawns.\n\nYET ANOTHER UPDATE: The tea smoked duck is ridiculously good.","630":"Cumin Lab, Water boil Fish, Eggplant, Spicy Crispy Chicken... Just a bunch of deliciousness. Pretty authentic. It is a Houston Chinatown must. I go here with my coworkers at least once in a couple of weeks for lunch.","631":"My brother in law and sister in law took us here for dinner since my mom in law suggested we go eat Chinese food. This place is more northern China food so lots of items on the menu are spicy. It was pretty crowded for this restaurant - we had to wait for 20 minutes or so for a party of 9. This restaurant was also in a plaza with other restaurants...those other restaurants had no wait, but this restaurant did so we thought this would be a very good place since we had to wait to get seated. My brother in law ordered most of the dishes. The prices are relatively cheap - we were surprised with the final bill. If you pay in cash you get a discount as well. The food was decent - I hardly eat Northern China food so it was a new adventure for me. I enjoyed the food. Some were spicy, some were not so spicy. We had a good time - good food for a good price.","632":"This place was OK.  The food was spicy but not as hot as the waiter claimed it would be.  I ordered the water boiled fish (it was so greasy, but I guess I should have expected that) and my husband got the spicy\/crispy chicken.  He loved his chicken but I was not overly impressed with the fish.  The taste was good, but it was nothing I'd ever order again.","633":"I really like the spices and flavors of the food here but wish that they could cut down on the salt in some dishes. I think sauteed baby bok choi and water boiled fish are too salty.","634":"good fair price and tucked away in the corner of the old chinatown extension. got the 'water-boiled chili fish' and cumin beef and chilled noodles. the cumin beef was SO tender it was sort of concerning (my mom said they might use powdered tenderizer...apparently not very healthy). the fish was a smaller portion but enough to make me full, and the noodles were refreshing. the whole meal was around $30, pretty good for a yummy authentic spicy meal. would recommend!","635":"We dined here twice and second time we had a roach in our Kung Pao chicken. I almost threw up my food. The waitress said we can leave and not pay because other customers heard\/saw how disgusted and shocked we looked. Never coming back again.","636":"Its good.  A bit on the pricey side and service was a bit slow.  It took about 35-40 min to start getting our food.  With that being said I am not sure we will go back again. Maybe.  We did not order everything and it was pretty clean.  The food was good when we got it.","637":"This is my favorite for authentic Chinese food. The Kung Pao is addictive. Other must try menu items- Dan Dan noodles, hot and sour soup, fried rice, and spicy crispy chicken. Huge portions, great prices, and amazing food!","638":"If you like spicy food, you can try this place . Crispy spicy chicken is pretty good.  Staff are friendly. Service pretty fast.","639":"I love spicy food and this place hit the spot! I went with Yelp recommendation of spicy and crispy chicken, water boiled fish, and map tofu. I like all of the dishes. The crispy chicken was a little bit salty and had too many peppers to chicken ration. However, the service was up to par!\n\nPay in cash for 5% discount.","640":"A simple restaurant with sometimes spotty service, but excellent food. Their food is so good that I'm ready to 'forgive' them the service and simple table clothing. Most of their menu is great, but I'm particularly 'addicted' to their Kung Pao Chicken. I could not find a similar dish in other places that could be better than that. But you need to love spicy food to truly appreciate it.","641":"It's unfortunate that this is no longer nearly as awesome as it used to be. The quality and flavor have all gone way down since they first opened. Popularity and growth can be killers. I gave them several chances and each visit was a little worse than the one before. I hope they can get back in the groove, but alas, I now have to search for a new favorite Sichuan place:(","642":"I'm commenting on the braised \"Lion Head\" meatballs ONLY because that's the only thing i've ever tried from this place.  Most of the menu items are intensely hot & spicy, which I seriously cannot eat.  Anyways, what makes me a fan of Mala Sichuan Bistro already?  The \"Lion Head\" meatballs baby!! Yes, it is THAT good!  Fried on the outside but very soft, juicy, and flavorful inside each one of those delicious meatballs.....just wonderful!  Each meatball is in the size of my fist!  Generous, isnt it?!  The meatballs are braised in brown sauce with veggie and sliced mushrooms, and the sauce is NOT excessively salty and not heavily thickened either, which is another good thing!  I would go back, just for the \"Lion Heads!\"","643":"Authentic Sichuan in Houston! Spicy Crunchy Chicken, Dumplings in Red Oil, Tea Smoked Duck all incredible. Some dishes on the menu are not for a westerner's palette but I am sure they are prepared as they are in China. Don't go for atmosphere, go for a delicious Sichuan meal, and try a few new dishes. Huge menu with many choices of chicken, duck, beef, pork etc...If you like Sichuan food, you won't be disappointed.","644":"Its been awhile since i have have had sichuan food and i seemed to have forgotten why i veered away from it and coming to this place I realize why the cravings to sichuan cuisine seemed to have dwindled down. \n\nIf you like oily spicy things, sichuan is for you. \nAt mala restaurant I had a huge family style meal with my family and the only thing that stuck out were the wontons in hot chili oil. I cant rave about the rest of the meal because honestly everything began to just taste the same. We had pork, chicken and beef. Unfortunately everything was seasoned similarly and it was tiring. I stuck with the wontons and the vegetables for the rest of the meal after trying the other dishes. Im not a fan but perhaps if i were to crave sichuan food i would come back for the wontons.","645":"A go to place for me and my husband for the water boiled fish and cucumber. If you order take out, ask them to separate the cold and the hot items (I use to get warm cucumbers otherwise.)","646":"I'm a Chinese coming to Houston for biz trip. This place is strongly recommended by my friends back in Shanghai. They are right. Definitely good Chinese food!","647":"First time on a recommendation from the daughter...good choice. Started with the Dan Dan noodles, perfection. Just the right amount of spice. Next up a winter melon and meatball soup. This is a bland follow up to the noodles, could have used a little chili oil or oyster sauce. Course three was the ma po tofu, the best dish of the evening. The tofu was fresh and silky, spiced just right and accented with ...leeks...yep! Last selection was the crispy and spicy chicken...which was exactly descriptive of what was on the plate. Small pieces of chicken with a breading of sorts, flash fried with a lot of red chiles and sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds. I wanted to like this but just not all that appealing. The chicken was dry.\n\nOverall, this is a good find and the menu has  lots of interesting dishes to try in the future. The table next to us  ordered one of the whole fish and it looked really tasty.  Service was good and the prices very reasonable. If you like a little spice in your food, this is a must try dining experience.","648":"The best spicy Szechuan cuisine in Houston hands down. The food comes out super fast and it's delicious!!! Service is pretty good for a high pace and volume Chinese restaurant. Props to the owner and her team!","649":"Ate here today and I was not disappointed!  Thanks to suggestion of previous reviews and Alison Cook's write up we ordered the following dishes - Dan Dan Noodles, House Noodles, Pork rolls, Funky chicken, Crispy & Spicy Chicken & Chengdu Style Prawns.  They were all delicious and definitely with a kick.   Be prepared, all dishes are spicy!  Although they are all distinct in flavor, they all have this chili paste\/oil base which is evident in all the dishes.  \n\nService was fast and friendly - the waiter was very helpful in our menu choices.  The restaurant is clean and fresh looking.  YES, we will be back!","650":"It's one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in Houston! The food is always consistent and delicious and service is good also! Most of their dishes are spicy though but super flavorful and tasty!  I like the celery chicken, house special spicy fried rice or noodle, garlic shredded pork, and twice cooked pork.  Highly recommended!!","651":"If you like spicy Sichuan cuisine, you need to visit Mala Sichuan Bistro pronto! Located at 9348 Bellaire Blvd, Mala has a deep menu of inexpensive dishes. The dan dan noodles were some of the best homemade noodles I've ever tasted, and at about $4 were a total bargain. The cumin beef is a total firecracker - absolutely delicious. We also ordered the spicy eggplant, which was one of the best eggplant dishes I've ever tasted. In an area full of great restaurants, you need to add Mala to your route of must-visit suburban Chinatown restaurants.","652":"Love, love Mala's! THE best food ever- everything from the Chengdu style fish, red oil dumplings, Dan Dan noodles, spicy beef and garlic Bok Choy!\n\nToo many to list! We have to have our Mala fix at least once or twice a month. And every couple we have taken gets hooked!\n\nThey get crowded early, but so worth the wait. Can't wait for the second location! This is my favorite Chinatown restaurant by far!\nThank you, Malas!","653":"To start off, yes, the food is good and affordable. Service overall is ok, except for one thing. They have a very bad tendency to try and serve as many customers as possible in their tiny place. As a result, they will not seat you until the whole party has arrived. The worst is that after a while, they told us to hurry because other people were waiting outside. That first lady looked apologetic, but the very act of asking us to leave is unacceptable. As we left, I told the waitress who was looking at the whole scene how I felt, to which she showed me her wait list and answered \"Do you see how many people are waiting? They're waiting to be served. You've been there for more than an hour!\".\n\nNow that I write this, I am reminded of when I invited my colleagues there for lunch last year. There were many of us so we got seated in one of the two rooms with the largest tables, the only tables that could fit us all. After we finished ordering the food, the lady looked at her list and said \"I am sorry, but to eat in this room, you need to order at least x dollars.\".\n\nAlso, they give you a 5% discount if you pay cash.\n\nTo sum up, they serve good food but their blatant greed just put us off. We are not coming back.","654":"Second visit trumped the first by far because we ordered better dishes: garlic bacon, cold beef tendon, couple's lung (beef & offal, not lung), crispy chicken, garlic water spinach (gotta get some greens in), and red oil wontons (better than their dumplings). Can't stop thinking about the food, and it's the next morning--always a good sign.","655":"I forgot what other dishes I had, but I loved the Cumin Beef! To this day, whenever I smell cumin, I imagine this delicious dish! I found this restaurant randomly and it never disappointed me! This place delivers authentic Sichuan cuisine, so spicy it's good! A must-visit every time I come to Houston.","656":"Nice atmosphere compared to some places in this area. Great service and the food... Is .... Awwwweeesssoommee. Today was my first time and I have a feeling this is going to be a regular spot -- even though it's a 30 min drive from my house!","657":"Food is good, taste is fine, portion though is not that big. Usually you need to wait for a while before you are seated. They also have the reputation of rushing people out when they finish.","658":"I used to come here a lot. but i went there last night, the food was not decent anymore, the waitress \"kicked us out\" before we finished our dinner. the waitress came over and asked me if i want to pay cash or credit card and brought the check when we were still eating. I came there at 7:00, and she brought me the check at 7:20\nSeriously?","659":"Absolutely delicious! I've lived in Sichuan for about a year and fell in love with mouth-watering, tongue-numbing taste of Sichuan food! After learning what the real food taste like, I can safely tell you that this restaurant has very authentic Sichuan food.  I have brought friends here that aren't the biggest Chinese food fans and they also fell in love with this place.  The only reason I'm giving four stars is that the service is sometimes a bit slow especially when it comes to serving drinks. The last time I was there I got my food way before I got my drink and had to ask numerous times for my drink. But the food was so good I didn't mind the wait too much!","660":"I must say this is the best Asian restaurant I've ever eaten at in Houston. It's my favorite!!!Their food is extremely delicious!!! I love coming here and always order new dishes and they never disappoint me at all. They really do have the best dishes!!!","661":"Favorite Sichuan restaurant, I always come at lunch time. My favorite dishes are stir fry cabbage with chili sauce, konjac duck stew (house special), and steam tilapia. Yummy","662":"Amazing! This is one of our favorite Chinatown restaurants. Spicy and very flavorful, our favorite dishes are the Spicy Crispy Chicken, Eggplant in Garlic Sauce, and Water Boiled fish.  The Mapo Tofu and Tea Smoked Duck are also great!","663":"If you like heat, salt and oil you'll love Mala.  I love spicy foods but I want flavor and salty & oily do not count.  Maybe it was an off night.  Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes.  I'm not sure but I probably won't be back.","664":"Three pepper beaten duck, beef tendon, beef skin, rabbit in oil sauce was very salty, cold noodle with kidney wasn't good.","665":"Food is Ok. Had been there 3 times, had the dan dan noodle, wonton, spicy fish, tofu. All food is too salty and some lacks of flavor.","666":"This is definitely the best spicy Chinese food we had in Houston. We had the house special noodle, mapo tofu, and a tilapia pot dish that I forgot what is called ( it's the first tilapia dish on the menu). I am very satisfied with the taste of the dishes. The service is good and fast, we got our food pretty quickly after ordering. Will definitely go back and try some other dishes!","667":"BYOB\n\nVery good Roasted Duck, good service, went on Saturday night and it was packed, so, I would recommend for anyone well versed in Chinese cuisine or the adventurous eater, but I would not take a picky eater or child here.\n\nI'd go back myself though.","668":"Good food and good service. Recommend Dan Dan noodle. Fish is a little bit oily. Will go back again.","669":"DELICIOUS!!! Water boiled fish, mapo tofu, fish-fragrant eggplant, spicy chicken, are all excellent.\n\nTrue to traditional Sichuan cuisine but not intimidating. This place is a gem. GO HERE NOW!!!","670":"I wanted to eat at Tao Do but it was closed, so my boyfriend said let me run it and see if they have fresh whole fish. The place was packed. I don't know about you but if I see a lot of Asian's eating somewhere or any race at there native restaurant I will lean towards going. So we sat down and ordered a spicy whole fish with house fried rice extra spicy and fried green beans. They give you complementary steamed rice. We both ordered Corona's. We didn't stop there then we ordered another steamed fish that has this delicious broth with green onions. The meal was so fantastic during my stay I went there once a week for two months the waiters knew me and would ask if I wantd the spicy fish or the one with the broth..I can't even wait to go back to Houston just to eat at this restaurant.","671":"Went to Mala  for the first time after years of going to spicy Sichuan. Our group ordered boiled fish, crispy chicken, eggplant, bok choy, cumin beef and whole tilapia. Boiled fish, crispy chicken, egg plant were great. Bok choy and whole tilapia were good. Will definitely return.","672":"SALTY, SALTY, SALTY!!!  If you like salty food then this place still might be a little too salty for you.  I left with my tongue paralyzed from the amount of salt.  \n\nI went based on all the great reviews on here only to be disappointed and wondering if I had an isolated incidence.  I ordered 4 dishes and all of them were heavily salted.  If it weren't so salty, I would have loved it but I just could barely eat more than a couple of bites of each dish.\n\nWill give them another try sometime in the future with me telling them to lay off the salt for my dishes.\n\nYucky, would have to be my rating for this visit.","673":"My mom loves this place. She thinks the dandan noodle tastes better than they are in China. I usually order the spicy boiled fish which is always so tender and spicy. I always leave the restaurant with a slight numbing sensation on my tongue. The lapi are great too. Wait staff is always attentive and the food comes out piping hot!","674":"You have to try the spicy chicken and the red oil cucumber salad.  Combined together in a single bite, they make up one of the best dishes in Houston.","675":"One of the best Chinese (Authentic) restaurants I have been to. If you love spicy food like I do, you have to come here. Not only is it spicy but it has amazing flavor to it. Now, not everything is spicy here but the other dishes are just as great.\n\nTheir service is above average when comparing it to other Chinese restaurants but not much to complain about. \n\nI always get the bean jelly as app and either the spicy crispy chicken or the spicy boiled beef as an entree. I would also recommend the garlic bacon & Chengdu Style Pot Roasted Tilapia. \n\nSo Good!","676":"I go often to meet a buddy for lunch. I've always enjoyed the food, but they have this weird thing about no lunch specials on Fridays. I just won't go on Fridays, but I'm hungry now for the spice.","677":"Typical chinatown restaurant. A very wide range of choices in the menu. Be careful about how spicy you order as it can get really spicy. Very good though. Their rabbit appetizer and duck main course (don't remember the chinese names) were the best dishes. Also liked the pork intestines which had a very nice flavor. Very fast service considering how busy it always is.","678":"Love their crisp spicy chicken. Service is always friendly. Good food and fast.","679":"I love this place! When I think of chinese food this is where I go.  The spicy mala beef is out of this world good","680":"I'm not a big fan of Szechuan style - most of the dishes are either spicy, cold, too salty or even worse, both. If you like spiciness, please do come here. My party ordered the cumin beef, meatball, crunchy fried chicken, twice-cooked pork, and fish fillet. Out of those, I liked the cumin beef and meatball the most. This place also has a couple private dining rooms that can be made to 1 by opening the separator. Note that this complex has several popular restaurants and a supermarket, so parking can be hectic.","681":"I finally was able to make it to lunch at Mala Sichuan today and it was disappointing.\n\nWent for a late lunch about 2pm and as I entered the restaurant I wondered whether they were open cause I didn't see any patrons.  I asked the only employee I saw and he stated they were open.\n\nAfter sitting down I decided to order something with garlic sauce since it is one of my favorites if it is made well.  It was described as spicy, garlic sauce.  The food came out pretty quickly.  I didn't taste any garlic and it wasn't spicy.   Very disappointing.  I ended up adding some chili oil to it.  Other than the occasional hit of ginger, I really didn't taste garlic nor did I see garlic.  Must have been garlic powder which is how the Americanized places tend to make it.  \n\nWhen I asked if they could make it spicy he said \"your dish only has 1 chili, you need to order something with 3 chilis if you like hot\".  Most other places would spice up a dish if you asked them too.  \n\nOne other thing I found odd is that they didn't refresh my tea with ice.  The refilled with tea only which became room temperature quickly.  I had to ask for ice which is just not common.\n\nWhile i was eating, they began to pour soapy water on the floor so they could mop.  Well by the time i was finished, the floor was still wet and I had to be extremely careful cause the floor was very slippery.  Not sure why they didn't wait til after the restaurant closes to do this but I sure wouldn't jeopardize an injury of a customer by doing this during a time when the restaurant is open.","682":"This is the best Sichuan restaurant I've been to. I'm from Sichuan and lived in LA, and been to many self-claimed Sichuanese restaurant. However, the other ones have all been very disappointing. Sichuanese food is not just simply spicy, it's only slightly spicy, but very flavorful and tasty. The spices the restaurant uses here is similar to the original spices I used to have in my hometown. All the appetizers and dishes are also very flavorful.","683":"Only thing good about this store is their ornaments. The dishes are all too sweet. Their spice doesnt really represent sichuan food at all. They changed the way they cook from few years ago, to a more american friendly restaurant. Not an authentic chinese restaurant to go for. Somehow they got really good business with bad location. They got plenty of tables and are all filled.","684":"Don't think twice. Just go eat here.  Won't be disappointed at all.  My favorite sichuan restaurant.  I like eating here and taking out. Only negative comment i can say is when i called in the afternoon for some food around 3.30pm, the guy said they have lunch break during 3 to 5pm.  So i was sad i couldn't order food.  But i understand...they are human and need a break. haha...there are other sichuan restaurants i tried but this is the best one out there.","685":"I've had the Dan Dan noodles, spicy crispy chicken, Cumin Beef, and the Mung bean changdu noodle (think I'm spelling it wrong) .  The dan dan noodles had great flavor and very satisfying for a cheap price.  The spicy crispy chicken was also very good and spicy, but the only thing I didn't like about it is that, the majority of the dish is just filled with peppers and the chicken pieces are very small.  I would like bigger chicken pieces or some white meat but that's my preference.  The cumin beef had a strong cumin taste and was just okay tasting.  The mung bean noodles tasted light and refreshing.  The service was good and if you pay cash you get 5% discount.  Not much unless you order a lot but I guess it's something.","686":"My friends and I dropped by Mala Sichuan last night and although we showed up about 30 minutes before closing, we received excellent service and our food came out quickly.  My friends and I split the spicy fried rice as an appetizer and it was unlike any fried rice I've ever had.  Although my mouth was on fire half way through eating my bowl of rice, I couldn't put my chopsticks down- it was that good.  For my entree, I ordered the spicy crispy chicken and wasn't impressed.  The chicken was dry and there wasn't too much to the dish. Two of my friends ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and it was delicious.  Another friend ordered the 4 Joy Lion meatballs and it was tasty as well.  Overall, I had a good experience and on my next visit, I definitely plan on ordering the Kung Pao Chicken!","687":"My friend who has traveled all over the East Asia was pleasantly surprised at the food, and found it to be the perfect balance of flavour and spice. The best Sinchuan cuisine he's had outside of Chengdu, China.  We had a large party of five and the waitstaff handled it excellently. Even though it was a Monday night, the place filled up quickly and was very lively. I'd recommend the Mapo Tofu, the Three Pepper Beaten Duck, and their House Special Whole Live Tilapia. The Prosper at 5 AM was the BEST pork intestine and pork blood dish any of us had ever had. Also recommended as an appetizer is the rabbit and the cold sinchuan noodles. All in all, I highly recommend it, would go there again. It was absolutely Glorious.","688":"Best Chinese I've ever had.  This is sichuan style food like I enjoyed on my recent trip to the Sichuan Provence.  Nothing could be more authentic.  The staff is nice too.  Try the dumplings in red oil.","689":"Good, but not as good as the new Montrose location. The three pepper beaten duck is better here but there are no dishes with green peppercorn here (a must try at the Montrose location, looks and tastes like the real water boiled fish\/beef dishes in China). The Sichuan food here just doesn't have enough of that authentic numbing flavor. Now that it's been hyped by the Houston Press it's also overrun by people trying to order egg drop soup. Please do us all a favor and stop forcing trendiness on yourself and go to Panda Express. Just admit that it's not for you and have that bland watered down food that you're actually craving.","690":"Been here about 3 times now.  Each time we go, I think, this time, we'll get the good stuff, the stuff people are raving about.  Unfortunately, we never end up thinking that (even though we read reviews before we order), and we leave with a greasy, oily feeling in our guts...with lots of food leftover.  Maybe it's because Sichuan food isn't our thing or maybe because the food is just drenched in that red chili oil.  We also find the food to be overly salty.  Is that just us, too?  Honestly, this 2 stars is because our waitress who helped us the last time was very nice and helpful.","691":"Yummy! This is one of the best Chinese cuisine I have ever had! The food is good and the prices are very reasonable!","692":"Dan Dan Noodles are totally yummy. Never had a bad dish here. I'm sure I wont want to know what they put in half of their dishes. :)","693":"Red oil dumplings dan Dan noodles and fish something boiling - super duper good!  Probably won't go anywhere in Chinatown bok Choy delish - not sure why anyone would give this place less stars","694":"Food is consistently good and service is quite good for an Asian restaurant. Everything I've tried is good. Beware, during dinner the line is out the door with a wait. Although, the food is so good I don't mind waiting. Noms!","695":"Huge hype around this place opening in Montrose, but big disappointment! Food is overly spicy, to the point where it has no taste other than fire and turns your stomach.","696":"For my money, this is the best Sischuan restaurant in Houston. The Dan Dan noodles are made locally for the restaurant and are amazing. According to the owner's daughter, the peppercorn are brought directly from Sischuan. I'm always amazed this place isn't packed when I arrive.","697":"This place is legit. Their \"spicy and crispy chicken\" is flavorful and salty, goes well with rice. The mapo tofu is also good, it's not that spicy but it does have the \"numbing spicy\" characteristic of this type of cuisine. The red oil dumplings are decent, they're salty and slightly sweet, but not really spicy like they should be, but still good. Their water boiled beef is spicier, but in my opinion not that special. The \"ants on the tree\" (vermicelli with ground meat) dish is solid, and the one they have not spicy. Unfortunately their dan dan noodles aren't very good, lacking in flavor and spiciness, and the noodles don't really match the flavor profile. This restaurant would be a hidden gem, but I suppose it's not exactly hidden, especially now considering that they're popular enough to have warranted another location in Westheimer.","698":"Here are my usual dishes for this place:  Water Boiled Fish, Cumin Beef, Spicy Crispy Chicken.  You should definitely come here if you want spicy and very bold and heavy flavored dishes.  Their lighter dish are pretty decent as well, but not as memorable.  But be warn to not come here if you want to eat healthy.  There spicy dishes are full of chilly oil and definitely not healthy.  But it is GOOD.  This is a cheat day or last meal restaurant.","699":"Well, I have been there for a couple times now and it is my favorite place to have Chinese\/Asian food apart from Banana Leaf in Chinatown. You can't beat their lunch special price. So far I always order \"Chengdu Pot roasted prawn' from their lunch menu. Tasty and you get 6 big size prawns with asparagus. However, their service needs to be improved. Always short of wait staff during peak lunch hours and have to wait to be served. Maybe next time, I should call in for to-go order. Oh yes, their special lunch menu you will get two side dishes of the day too but I never seem to get them??? Weird but not a big deal. My 3 years old daughter likes this place too. She called this restaurant 'Little bear\" as they give her 'FIT\"-Japanese store's  flatware and cutlery to eat with her meals. She somehow feels special:)  No other Chinese restaurant does that.","700":"I have got to say I expected more from this place after the reviews I have read. The atmosphere was alright and our waitress was nice. But I I have to say the manager is one of the rudest people I have ever met. I don't understand how your staff can make a mistake and you can't compensate for it. It must be some misguided confidence. The food is alright at best. We order four different dishes. The king po chicken was mediocre. Something I could have eaten anywhere else. The chicken with Serrano peppers and triple pepper duck was good. However, what was really disgusting, absolutely terrible is the beef stew. It tasted like oil and peppers with disgusting tasteless meat. I have got to say this place was not all its hyped to be and I think their manager needs to get back on the ground because if you can't respect your patrons you have no business being in the restaurant business.","701":"All the other reviews are on point here.  The food is super fresh & super good !!!  I mean the scent of the food is euphoric in this place!!! The spices here are different.  Its not a burn like say hot sauce or peppers.  It's more like a numbing sensation.  The sea clams app totally numbed me out (haha) but they were very intriguing to the senses.  The flavor was bold but yet smooth and delicious.  The dan dan noodles were the same; a spice I've never experienced before that just numbs the tongue yet at same time heightens the tastebuds. I was salivating the whole while gobbling up these delights.  The combo chow mein was on point and the kung pao recommended by the waiter was redic good!!! He said they make it the authentic way and I loved it.  The price to portion is excellent.  To say it was dinner and not lunch, each dish was $5-$8 so for 3 ppl approx $30 (2 main dishes & 2 apps) is a great bargain.  I will def being going back here for more numbing spice love and goodness!!!","702":"Probably my favorite place in China Town. We've been probably 20 times over the past 3 years and for the most part they have had consistently great quality food and service (given that it IS in China Town). The food is cheap and super yummy! My favorites are the funky stick chicken, water boiled beef, three pepper chicken. There's a couple that I don't know the names of but something similar to beef with peppers and an eggplant dish. Also, I don't eat duck, but my husband absolutely loves the three pepper beaten duck. Everyone should get this place a try! And in case you haven't read already, 5% off if you pay cash. :)","703":"Our group of five adults went for an early dinner at 6PM on a Tuesday. We had our choice of tables. When we finished dinner, the place was packed with a waiting line. Go early. This is a very popular restaurant. \n\nVery clean, good service, tablecloths on the tables, excellent food quality, generous portions, reasonable prices, BYOB.\n\nSechuan Chinese food is spicy. The items on the menu are marked with 1 to 3 peppers to indicate relative heat. A 1 rating isn't spicy, a 3 rating is quite spicy. We liked the Sechuan type of spiciness. It burns a bit when you first taste but the burning doesn't linger. It is extremely flavorful and quite good.\n\nWe had a lot of dishes. Each dish was a generous portion sufficient to feed five people with some left overs. We had the cold Sehuan spicy noodles and chicken stick appetizers, the Cumin Beef, Lion's Head Meatballs, Shrimp Chenghu pot, Three Pepper Duck, Baby Bok Choy, and Dan Dan Noodles.  \n\nEveryone's favorite dish was the Lion's Head meatballs. They are about the size of tennis balls, very juicy, in a tasty braising liquid, and not spicy. Everything was good. The only mild complaints were that the shrimp were served with the shells on making for a bit of finger work. The cumin flavor is quite pronounced so don't order the Cumin Beef unless you like the cumin spice.\n\nOne thing we especially liked would be the unique menu items. It seems like almost all Chinese restaurants in Houston offer variations of the same dishes (e.g.: Mu Shu Pork, Pot Stickers, Orange Beef, Lettuce Wraps, Chicken Kung Pao, etc.). Not so for Mala Sichuan Bistro. Most of the items on the menu are dishes rarely seen elsewhere. It's a bit of an adventure ordering, and an adventure of the nicer kind.\n\nOur bill came to $75 with a 5% discount for paying cash and not including tip. This is a BYOB restaurant so we brought our own wine.  What a great bargain! Only $15 per person for lots and lots of really great food.","704":"there's a reason why all the big name chefs in Houston can be found in this place at odd hours.  the food is intense, pulling no punches and throwing no jabs.  the textures are graceful (even delicate) but the flavors are anything but.  great stuff here if you appreciate authentic chinese food.  PRO TIP: the staff knows the menu well, don't be afraid to ask and take suggestions.","705":"I'm so addicted this to this place.  I'm a huge fan of the the four joy lion head and spicy crispy chicken.  You really can't go wrong with this place.","706":"Good food!  Had crispy spicy chicken and tasted great but it left a strange tangy aftertaste in my mouth.  Also, had dan dan noodles and bun bean jelly noodles.   Good noodle dishes.  I'd come back to try other stuff.","707":"Went Sunday at 1pm. Almost full.  Service impeccable.  Manageable fare on menu. Within 5 minutes of placing order, food, all food, on table. Vegetable dishes are superb.  Try cooked with chilis!  Broiled shrimp delicious. Prices reasonable.","708":"Amazing authentic Chinese food! I always order the Dan Dan noodles and hot and sour soup along with other dishes!!! Those two are the must haves every time. So amazing! I wish they offered fried dumplings. Their hot oil dumplings are too soft\/slippery for me consistency wise.","709":"The only thing makes me feel not too disappointed in Houston. A restaurant with nice service, clean dishes, yummy and traditional Chinese food. It is a good place for family dinning. Though the room is kind of crowd, you have to sit by the other table, the good is the best. Sometimes you have to wait outside for a table for a long time.","710":"Everything was way way salty. Kind of took over the whole meal. I've heard rave reviews of this place but we just didn't have that 5 star experience.","711":"The worst Chinese food and service. The place is dirty and the location is filthy. The food I ordered tasted like rotten mushroom. I requested to change the dish but they rejected. Chinese restaurants in this area are really inconsiderate. They only care about the profit and not the satisfaction of their customers. I wasted a good$50 good two people in the food that we cannot even eat. Everything was left untouched on the table due to the bad taste of their food.","712":"This restaurant try to make more money by not allowing you go to table If not all people be together. So they can rotate more customer. Very Unpleasant experience over there . Would not recommend if you invite people in.","713":"Most dishes are yummy. \n\nMy favorites are their water boiled fish & dan dan noodles. \n\nAtmosphere is not bad, esp. in Chinatown. \n\nI wish they would continue their livingsocial takeout option though... \n\nWas told their fish dishes using live fish were not worth the money.","714":"Very spicy. Very good.  Cumin  beef was well seasoned, crispy spicy chicken was more peppers than chicken, but delicious and attractive. Ample portion sizes. Long wait on a Saturday night.","715":"Maybe it's just me but I wasn't super impressed by this place. But then again I'm not the biggest fan of chinese food. The food was very salty also. The most interesting thing was definitely the peppercorns though they made my tongue go numb for a while.","716":"I love this place!!! My co-workers and I go there during lunch at least once a week. Their spicy crispy chicken, eggplant, cold spicy noodles and greenbeans are a MUST on our weekly visit.","717":"Some of the best Chinese food I've ever had! Also good customer service and clean restrooms. We had the garlic bok choy, crispy chicken, satay beef, dan dan noodles, and red oil dumplings. Definitely going back! Craving it actually ;) Can't wait!","718":"There are many Chinese restaurants in the same area. This one is not one of the best. The dishes are small. You have to order a lot to feed your stomach. Consequently, it is not cheap to eat in this place.","719":"Fantastic food. Spicy or not, well-prepared with quality ingredients. Mala beef jerky is outstanding. Sichuan cold noodle salad, beef kidney salad and mala roast fresh-out-of-a-tank tilapia were stand-outs so far. Friendly owners and staff, good service. You've got to try the lunch specials, too. Good value.","720":"I thought this place would be top notch especially when I read so many good reviews on yelp but it was a big disappointment. The portions here were small and 1\/2 of the plates were filled with dry chili. The taste of the food was just meh....... I've had way better food. I don't think it's very clean here either because I got sick after eating the food. The ice water tasted like unfiltered tap water too. I don't think I would go back here unless there's absolutely no other place to eat in chinatown. Many people complained about the service, but I think that the service is quite good especially for a chinese restaurant. The most important thing about a restaurant is its food not service so it was a pity.","721":"I do not like spicy food and was prepared to just politely move food around on my plate when I went here with friends. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the spiciness wasn't hot, but more like a tingling burn. Your mouth literally goes numb but you can still taste the food. It was a great meal and we all had a wonderful time.","722":"The best sichuan food I've ever had!  Every dish here is amazing.  There is never a wait, food comes out quickly, and service is prompt.  They also offer a discount if you pay in cash! This restaurant is my top 10 favorite places in Houston!","723":"The melon and meatball soup was so refreshing that I feel I coud eat that all the time.  The fillet fish with tofu - basically mapo tofu with fish - is too die for.  I wish there was more!  The yang chow fried rice had the right combination of eggs, shrimp and ham and saltiness.  It's quite delicious.  My BF ordered chicken with celery because he doesn't like spicy.  I kept wanting to have more of that but held myself because I know he could only eat the non spicy stuffs.  But the most refreshing thing about the place was that the waitress was friendly, ready to serve with a smile and informed u at the end, if you paid cash, they would knock 5% of off your bill.  Good deal!  Will definitely comeback often.","724":"I have lived in the SF Bay and Chicago, both areas of excellent Chinese food, of which Sichuan is my fave.  Chinese food in Houston, which mostly consists of \"Asian\" menus containing Chinese, Thai, Japanese and Vietnamese dishes all done poorly, has been my largest food disappointment since arriving here 6 years ago.  I remember fondly my time at Jade Garden near McCormick in ChiTown where we were the only non-Chinese speakers in the restaurant and chose from the much shortened English menu.  Downtown for my son's Zoofari camp, I decided to give Chinatown Houston a go.  I'm so glad I did.  I chatted with an Octagenerian couple from Taiwan and ordered Kung Pao chicken and Eggplant with Garlic sauce.  Like a Thomas Keller table, no condiments (read soy sauce and red pepper) were on the table to ruin the chef's creation.  I guess that was my first clue this was the real deal.  The food was deftly flavored and sauced, potatoes and cabbage served as side dishes.  White rice underneath, meat and eggplant added, I was in heaven, if only for an hour.  I requested soy for the rice but did not use it.  One word of caution...do not bite or eat the Chinese peppercorn served in the dishes.  (See Yelp's description).  I accidentally did and my mouth was negatively flavored by the spicy orange\/cardamom taste for much of the meal. My new favorite restaurant in H-town.","725":"Spicy crispy chicken is worth the trip alone.  Eggplant, pork dumplings, and roast duck are also really good.  But man, that chicken...","726":"I love this restaurant. I've eaten here over 10 times, both dine in and take out , and never had a disappointing experience. So far, my favorites are the Mala beef and tofu, crispy intestines, boil fish, and red oil wontons. I wish I can try everything on the menu, but everything I've tried so far have been good, it's so hard not to order it again on the follow up visit. Restaurants like Mala makes me wish I had more than one stomach.","727":"four stars solely for the 3 cup chicken.\n\nit's not authentic Taiwanese 3 cup chicken but I love it.\n\nother dishes are ok.\nthe Sichuan dishes we ordered are just ok.\nthe spicy chicken is not as crispy as it supposed to be.","728":"My husband and I wanted to try this place out bc of the ratings on yelp. I don't know if these people that give this place a 5star ate the same food we ate! We ordered all the popular dishes. Dan Dan noodles, crispy chicken and the dumplings. Coming from Louisiana so you know we love salty food but the food here was BEYOND SALTY!! It was so salty that my tongue was going numb from all the salt! While I was telling my husband about my tongue was going numb. We over heard the couple next to us was saying the same thing! This place is a definitely a no-go!! We had to stop eating and went on to another restaurant. Ugh..","729":"I thought this place was just okay. It was crazy crowded on a Friday night and there is no waiting area so we were just standing next to people dining for about 40 minutes. We got to look around at some of the dishes and check out the menu but nothing looked that appetizing to me. We end up ordering Dan Dan noodles, salt toasted shrimp, combo fried rice, and Kung pao chicken. The dandan noodles was too spicy for me but my boyfriend really liked it. The Kung pao chicken was weird. It was super pungent and I would eat random bits of chili pepper and it made my mouth tingle and then go numb. I don't think food is supposed to do that to you. The only dishes I liked was the combo fried rice and the salt toasted shrimp. I guess I just need to go with someone who knows the menu better and can order good stuff because I was just lost. Probably will be back because boyfriend keeps talking about those Dan Dan noodles.","730":"I nerd to preface this review with the fact that i love spicy food. We took out mala and didnt expect glory. We got original wontons for our son, crispy spicy chicken, spicy eggplant and the dan dan noodles. Let me first say that perhaps I don't really understand Sichuan cuisine and the piles of red chili peppers that are on the dish. I am addicted to spicy food and eat some really spicy stuff. When I saw the crispy chicken and the (i kid not) at least 50 chopped red chilies in it, i I ask myself, am I really supposed to eat all of these chilis. Last time I went to another Sichuan place in china town the next day it felt like an atomic bomb went off in my stomach from cleaning the plate of 50 red chilis. With this particular dish, the crispy chicken was cut so small that it would be near impossible to not eat at least a few of the chilis. Anyways i forgot the feeling i had the previous time and ate away, probably eating 75 percent of the chilis before i said no more as i cried tears of joy. I regretted it the next day. Anyways, on to the spicy eggplant. This was really good actually. It was sweet and semi spicy which really complimented each other. I would order this again if we came back. My sons wontons were forgettable. Not like the awesome ones down the street at Tan Tan. The dan dan noodles were too oily for me. I have never had them before, so they might be awesome for peopel that are used to them, but for me they just tasted over oily. Overall, I like Mala and want to give it another change and actually dine in. This way I can ask someone if you are really supposed to eat all the chilli peppers?!!","731":"Been going here for about a year.  It has gone downhill since all of the positive press.  The service is still very good.  The dumplings and dan dan nood were good.  The chicken dishes were all dark meat and of poor quality.  Not a great meal and certainly not a top 20 restaurant in Houston.","732":"My coworkers and I enjoy going to this place about once a week for lunch. Food is great and come out in timely manner. The reason I give this place 4 stars out of 5 is because sometimes the food is inconsistent (mainly the saltiness).","733":"Awesome!  Loved the food.  Agreed getting there was hard.  Awful construction.  But the menu was great. My tongue was totally numb!","734":"The food at Mala Sichuan, when it is on point, is delicious and that is why we keep going back.  We have tried so many dishes that we love: crispy mala beef, spicy crispy chicken, tea smoked duck, crispy chicken, dan dan noodles, original wontons, hot & sour soup, dry fry double veggies, pretty much all the veggies prepared every way, the list goes on and on.  It's best if you get a mixture of spicy and non-spicy dishes so your palate doesn't go numb.   Everything besides the food, from the service to the prices to the cleanliness are disappointing.  They are always way understaffed and poorly organized.  Your food just may sit in the kitchen until it goes cold or else they completely forget something you ordered.  Also, the standards for hygiene need help.  The bathrooms are always messy, dirty and just generally in a state of disrepair.  I have seen one of the chefs smoking inside the kitchen.  Sometimes your dishes come out still dirty on the outside.  The food is fantastic but the restaurant needs quite a bit of help before it will be 4 or 5 stars.","735":"Best restaurant in Houston, or at least in the Bellaire area, that I have been too, for Sichuan style Chinese. Sichuan is know for the spicy foods, made with a lot of peppers, but there is still other things to try if you cannot handle it, and the waiters are happy to help you find something that you can handle and can even make sure the food is less spicy and easier for you to handle. Being Mexican, I prefer the food extra spicy. Whenever I go out to eat, at least for Asian food, I always go with one of my chef friends, and if he likes this place, then it must be good. Last time we went we were able to get a lot of food for a good price. We just ordered a bunch of stuff and shared it, and there is always rice to help you get full. Try the spicy chicken and  the shrimp, but don't be afraid to try something new that you may have never heard of or tasted, as you might be surprised. Also, me and my friends have a joke about this place how some of the dishes on the menu have names that sound like crazy attacks from an anime or fighting game. If you have been here you will know what I am talking about. If you are ever in the area, don't be afraid to check it out.","736":"If you want a taste of real Sichuan food, this is the place.  Although it's not healthy to consume spicy Sichuan food too frequently, I would like to say this is probably the best Sichuan restaurant in town.","737":"This is a Chinatown must! Went for dinner last night at 9.30, 30 minutes before closing time, and still got good service. About 5 minutes after our table got our food, the whole kitchen staff ran out the door. I went with 3 other people. We started off with the spicy combination rice, and funky stick chicken. The spicy rice was spicier than I had anticipated, but very, very good. The funky stick chicken was very different and very tasty, it was cold and delicious! I ordered the 4 joy lion meatballs, and was extremely pleased. My meatballs were incredibly tender and bursting with flavor. My tongue didn't know what was going on, it was experiencing new flavors that left it baffled and excited. My boyfriend and his brother both got the kung pao chicken, which was very good, minus the giant chunks of ginger. The chunks were so large, that the flavor was overwhelming, we were all scared to keep eating after unknowingly encountering a giant chunk of ginger. My girl friend got the crispy chicken, the most popular dish on the menu, according to our waitress. If you like peppercorns, you will like this dish. If you don't like peppercorns, then stay away from it!! I loved it, the chicken bits were fried and incredibly flavorful. Over all, dinner was fantastic. The menu is giant so pick a protein and stick to that page or you might get overwhelmed.","738":"Crazy good! We make the drive from Katy regularly. Love it!
