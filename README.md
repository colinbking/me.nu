# *Me.nu*

*Me.nu is a web application optimized for mobile platforms that creates individually-tailored menus. It uses
 Yelp, Google Reviews, and user-specific preferences to determine the perfect recommendations for me n you.* 

# Menu Item Rating Algorithm 
We wrote this algorithm for our program to rate each dish from the menu input. It factors in the average rating, a correction factor for other reviewers' perceptions of the dish as positive or negative, as well as the tendency of better items to typically have more reviews overall.
