       "\"If I could give Mala more stars, I would.  Our meal here was absolutely amazing and I am already making plans to go back whenever I return to Houston!\\n\\nWe came on a busy night but did not have to wait too long to grab a table (with a lazy susan no less!!).  We ordered the red oil dumplings, the red oil rabbit, the dan dan noodles, the mapo tofu, the three pepper beaten duck, the chengdu style pot roasted prawns, and the mala crispy beef.  Oh. My. Goodness.  Everything was amazing!! The dan dan noodles were nice and chewy and full of spicy flavor.  The wrapping on the dumplings were chewy and had such a great mouth feel.  The mapo tofu sauce was thick and spicy and went perfectly with our steaming hot rice.  The duck was tender and crispy and moist.  The prawns were juicy and absorbed all that rich flavor - not to mention they were a good size! The mala crispy beef was a show stopper - thinly sliced spicy crispy morsels... delicious!  I didn't enjoy the rabbit as much as I thought I would because there were so many bones amongst the meat, but the meat tasted great. \\n\\nThe service there was great - our waiter was very nice and made sure we had everything we needed.  Overall, it was a very enjoyable feeling and we devoured almost every last bite!  I recommend this place with very high regard - I cannot wait to come back!\""
